            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>that Ploughs his Ground, and ſows nothing upon it; and he that Reſolves, but Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutes not, is yet more ſottiſh; for he is at all the coſt, and takes all the pains, but reaps no Fruit of his Labours. There is ſuch a near connexion between Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Reſolution, and Execution, and they are ſo Naturally conſequent upon one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that as on the one ſide, Conſideration brings on Reſolution, and that Practice; ſo much more on the other, from a Mans Practice we may ordinarily pronounce of his Reſolutions, and from that certainly Calculate his Meditations. But to the point in hand: <q>I (ſaith the Prodigal) have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed too long already, I may conſider and make Reſolutions, and yet ſit and ſtarve; it muſt be doing muſt Reſcue me from my Miſery.</q> 
                     <hi>So he aroſe:</hi> And ſo doth the true Penitent; and our of hand cloſes with Jeſus Chriſt upon Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terms.</p>
                  <p>But obſerve further: The Prodigals Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance is here termed, <hi>a coming to himſelf,</hi> as if he had been out of his Wits, or beſides himſelf, before his amendment: So then we may from hence draw this <hi>Doctrine, viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> That a Man in his ſins is out of his Senſes, he is a Mad-man and out of his Wits:
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:59886:75"/>Sinners are Bedlems and Lunaticks, void of Senſe and Reaſon. Methinks theſe words of the Prophet <hi>Eſay,</hi> may ſufficiently prove this, in the 46th. Chapter, Verſe the 8th. where he ſaith, <hi>Remember this, and ſhew your ſelves men, bring it again to mind, O ye Tranſgreſſors.</hi> The words may be thus read: <hi>Return to your minds, O ye Tranſgreſſors!</hi> Or, <hi>Return into your Hearts,</hi> as <hi>Calvin</hi> reads them; obſerving this very point from thence, that they were not well in their Wits before. So <hi>Muſculus, Mentzerus,</hi> with many others.</p>
                  <p>And indeed the words uſually uſed for Repentance, both <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine,</hi> doth ſhew as much; the <hi>Greek</hi> word is derived of another, which ſignifieth Folly and Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and is as much as after-wit: And for the <hi>Latine</hi> word, the Prophet in the former place cited, ſeemeth to give the ſignification of it. And it is no wonder, for their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Judgment are now corrupted through ſin; ſo that, as our Saviour Chriſt, and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed St. <hi>Steven</hi> ſaith, <hi>they know not what they do.</hi> And is it not the very definition of a Mad-man, to be without Judgment, to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his Fancy, and to be led by appearances without Trial? See for further Proof, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.9. <hi>Luke</hi> 6.11.</p>
                  <p>Let the uſes of the point be theſe: Firſt, it may inform our Judgments concerning
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:59886:76"/>ſin and ſinners: Sin is Madneſs, ſinners are Lunaticks, being poſſeſſed with a Spiritual Frenne and Madneſs. Look upon them with a Spiritual Eye, and their Actions will declare it. Some run to and fro ſtark Naked, and bluſh not, tearing off, and caſting away the Garments of Holineſs and Innocency. <hi>Were they aſhamed</hi> (ſaith <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remiah) nay, nay, they were not aſhamed.</hi> Are Men aſhamed of their flagitious courſes, which layeth them Naked both to ſhame and judgment? Alas no! they glory in them, never bluſhing for the committing of them: Others, (though ſometimes they keep with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Compaſs, and ſeem to be well governed, as if they were no ſuch Men) being a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle diſpleaſed, or any thing croſſed, ſtrait fall a playing of their Mad pranks, raging and raving againſt Heaven and Earth, cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and banning all that ſpeak to them, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting the very Air with their vile Speeches and horrible Oaths, as if they would pluck God out of his Throne, and again Crucifie the <hi>Son of God</hi> afreſh.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Others</hi> foam at the Mouth, their talk is Idle and Beaſtly, ſavouring neither of Wit nor Honeſty; ſparkles of Hell come forth from their lips, whereat the Devil kindles fire of Diſſention.</p>
                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:59886:76"/>
                  <p>And again, how deeply are others poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed with this ſpirit of Madneſs? Who are never well but when they are Wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Beating, and Deſtroying of themſelves and others; waſting their Eſtates, confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming their Bodies, and pitifully ſlaſhing of their Conſciences and Souls, yea, killing and deſtroying whoever they keep Company with, drawing them into the ſame exceſs of Riot, that ſo they may all periſh together. <hi>And in a word,</hi> what Mad Property is to be ſeen in any <hi>Bedlem,</hi> that is not to be found in a Wicked Man? Oh! happy were it, if the Rod of Diſcipline were better uſed, then there would be hope of more Sobriety.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, is this ſo, that Sinners are <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naticks?</hi> Let it then admoniſh all ſuch as are well in their Wits to keep out of their <hi>Companies.</hi> Men <hi>Bodily</hi> Mad, are kept bound and Chained, and narrowly watched over, that they cannot hurt; and yet we are loath to come within their reach, we never fear theſe Spiritual <hi>Bedlems,</hi> of whom we ought to be moſt wary, being they are at Liberty in every place and houſe, in moſt Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and many times have power to Hunt; and yet (the more is the pity) how care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs are we? Oh! be more watchful, you that Love your ſelves, be more careful, come not in their Company, receive them
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:59886:77"/>not into your Houſes, unleſs Neceſſity com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel: What though they keep within Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs for a time, in ſome Months Mad-men ſeem ſober, yet firſt or laſt they will have their Fits, <hi>and much endanger your Souls and Bodies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The laſt <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> ſhall be an <hi>Exhortation</hi> to ſuch as are yet in the ſtate of Nature, to pity themſelves, and Pray for themſelves, that they may have their Senſes reſtored to them: When thou ſeeſt a <hi>Lunatick</hi> to rage and <hi>rave,</hi> to rend and tear his Hair and Fleſh, thou canſt not but pity and ſend forth a Prayer for him, that God would help him: Behold, <hi>Oh Man!</hi> thine own Eſtate, ſuch a one art thou, void of all Senſe and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Underſtanding, who doſt <hi>daily wound</hi> thine own Soul by ſin; be as Merciful to thy ſelf as thou art to <hi>others;</hi> bewail thine own <hi>fearful Eſtate,</hi> cry to God for help and redreſs; never give over till thou art brought to thy ſelf; and being once Cured, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſerate the eſtate of others that are not. Turn not their Mad pranks into a Jeſt (as moſt do) but turn to God by Prayer for their Recovery, as few do.</p>
                  <p>But now let us in the next place ſee what are the Conſiderations the Prodigal enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains his thoughts upon in this his Afflicted
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:59886:77"/>condition, and here we ſhall find theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducible to theſe following heads.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He conſiders what the condition was he is fallen from, and how Happy he might have been, had it not been <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> his own Folly. <hi>How many hired Servants,</hi> &amp;c.. <hi>q. d.</hi> I that am pinched with Want now, felt none in my Father's Houſe; I was Liberally main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, Honourably treated, wanted no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the Wiſdom to underſtand my own Felicity, and in this condition I might have continued; for neither did my Father's Eſtate complain of the Burthen of my Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodations, nor was he ſtrait-handed, or abated any thing of his Fatherly Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons towards me; it was nothing but my own Folly Ruined me. And then,</p>
                  <p>He proceeds to deplore the ſad Eſtate he is fallen into: When I ſet out from my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Houſe in queſt of Liberty, did I ever dream of becoming a Slave? When I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed the Liberal Proviſions of his Family, did I, or could I have thought I ſhould come to want Bread, to feed upon Husks? How ſad is the changel how ſevere is my Fate, which I know no more how to bear, than how to avoid! But this is not the worſt yet: For,</p>
                  <p>He fore-thinks what is like to be the Iſſue of this; it is not only feeding upon Husks,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:59886:78"/>but <hi>I periſh for Hunger:</hi> I have a proſpect of nothing but Death before me in the caſe I am in; I am loſt, undone, undone in moſt dreadful Circumſtances; for I periſh, and it is with Hunger; Death makes its ſure approaches, and that in the moſt ghaſtly ſhape; <hi>Vivens videnſque pereo, I ſee and feel my ſelf dying.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But yet in the laſt place, he looks about him to ſee if there be not ſome eſcape. <q>I am dying (ſaith he) but not quite dead; whilſt there is Life there is Hope: Who will not catch hold of any thing rather than periſh? And it agrees not with my Condition to ſtick at any thing that can miniſter the leaſt probability of ſafety. Am not I a Son, though I am here a Slave? Have not I a Father, and hath not he pity? Why then do I ſtand ſtill and die, and not rather make the utmoſt Experiment?</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And here we may fancy the <hi>Prodigal</hi> thus Arguing with himſelf: Woe and alas is me! this miſerable Life cannot laſt always, Death will Arreſt me ſhortly, and preſent me before a juſt Tribunal; the Grave will ere long cover me, but not be able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal me, for I muſt come to Judgment; methinks I hear already the ſound of the laſt Trump, <hi>Let the Dead ariſe, let them come to Judgment.</hi> I ſee the Angels as Apparitions
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:59886:78"/>gathering all the World together, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting them before that dreadful <hi>Tribunal.</hi> How ſhall I be able with my guilty Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to appear upon that huge <hi>Theatre,</hi> before God, Angels, and Men? Methinks I ſee the Devil ſtanding at my Right hand to aggravate thoſe faults which he prompted me to the commiſſion of; I behold the Books opened, and all the Debaucheries, Extravagancies and Follies of my whole Life laid open: <hi>Chriſt</hi> the Judge of all the World coming in flaming Fire, to take Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance upon them that have not known him, nor obeyed his Goſpel; how ſhall I endure his preſence? How ſhall I eſcape his Eye? I cannot delude his Judgment, nor evade his Sentence; <hi>Come then, ye Rocks and fall upon me, and ye Mountains cover me from the face of the Lamb, and from him that ſitteth upon the Throne.</hi> But the Rocks rend in ſunder, the Sea and the Earth diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſe their Dead, the Earth diſſolves, the Heavens vaniſh as a ſcroll, and I hear the dreadful Sentence, <hi>Depart ye curſed into everlaſting fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels.</hi> Methinks I hear <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> thus upbraiding me: You have liſtened to the Devil, and not to me; I would have ſaved you, but you would not be ruled by me; you have choſen the way of Death,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:59886:79"/>now therefore you ſhall be filled with your own ways; I fore-warned you what would be the Iſſue of your Courſes, but you would have your full ſwing of Pleaſure for the preſent, whatever came of it hereafter: You laughed at Judgment, and it is come in earneſt; you have had your time of Jol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and ſenſual tranſports, and now your Portion is <hi>weeping and wailing and gnaſhing of teeth.</hi>

                  <p>But is there no hope left? Muſt I lie down thus in ſorrow and diſpair? Theſe things I may juſtly expect, but they are not yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent upon me; I am yet alive, and they ſay there is hopes in the Land of the Living; the Door is not yet ſhut againſt me, Hell hath not yet cloſed her mouth upon me. I have heard God is a Merciful God, and thereupon I preſumed hitherto, and abuſed his goodneſs; but ſure his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies are above the meaſure of a Man, if they be infinite like himſelf; he hath more Goodneſs than I have Ingratitude. Poſſibly there may be ſome hope left in the bottom of this <hi>Pandora's</hi> Box of Calamities: If there be none, it is in vain to Repent, fruitleſs to Weep, endleſs to Bewail, madneſs to add to my own Infelicities. If there be a rigid Fate upon me, I will <hi>curſe God, and dye.</hi> But ſure whilſt there is a God, there muſt
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:59886:79"/>be goodneſs, his Name ſpeaks his Nature; will he <hi>break a bruiſed Reed?</hi> Will he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with Duſt and Aſhes? It is true, he hath no need of me, but for the ſame Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon he cannot delight in my Miſery: He cannot Repent and change his mind, becauſe his Wiſdom fore-ſaw from the beginning all poſſible contingencies; but if I Repent and change my mind, the ſame unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs of his, will oblige him as well then to ſave me, as before to deſtroy me. How far he will extend Mercy, and what inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces he will make of it, I cannot define; but who knows but he may yet admit of my ſubmiſſion? however, I cannot be worſe than I am, and it is poſſible my condition may be better; here I periſh certainly, if I caſt my ſelf upon his goodneſs, I can but periſh, therefore I will try: <hi>I will ariſe, and go to my Father,</hi> &amp;c. And thus his delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration brings him to reſolution, which is the ſecond Stage of Repentance.</p>
                  <p>But here I think it proper in the next place for the benefit of all that ſhall read this Book, but eſpecially for the ſake of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cogitant Youth, here again to give the ſame Paraphraſe (formerly given) upon the whole Parable of the Prodigal Son, that ſo all may more fully ſee the deplorable effects of Raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Folly, Pride and Curioſity, Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:59886:80"/>and Diſobedience, how they work joyntly and ſeverally together, and by turns, till by degrees they have trained poor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderate Man to his utter Ruine. And in the following Paraphraſe you may ſee lively Pourtrayed the beginning, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, the up-ſhot, the Cauſes, and the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of a ſinful Courſe.</p>

                     <q>A certain Man had two Sons, one where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and he the Eldeſt, continued always in his Family, content with his Proviſion, ſubject to his Government, and in dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Obedience to all his Commands. But the other, <hi>viz.</hi> the Younger, full of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venile heat and confidence, conſiders him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at the Age of Diſcretion, grows im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient of Reſtraint, and deſirous of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, eſpecially fancying that he could Live better to his own content, and every whit as well provide for himſelf, if he were at his own diſpoſal: Therefore he deſires his Father to ſet him out his ſhare, and to put his Portion into his own Hands, and leave him to his own conduct. The Father gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifies him in all his deſires, gives him his Portion and his Liberty; which done, the Son, as if his Fathers Preſence or vicinage would put too great a reſtraint upon him,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:59886:80"/>and give check to his Freedom, he betakes himſelf to another Countrey, where being in the height of his Jollity amongſt his Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots and lewd Companions, methinks I hear him ſpeak to his own Heart after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner following, <hi>viz.</hi>

                     <q>But to proceed: This Prodigal being now out of his Fathers Eye, Reach, and
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:59886:81"/>Controul, he indulges himſelf in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſurfeit of Licentiouſneſs, by which means in a ſhort time (whilſt he enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the preſent, took no care for the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) the ſtock his Father allotted him, was utterly exhauſted, and with that his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures alſo fail, the Roots that miniſtred to them being thus dryed up; and where his Pleaſures end, his Cares begin: For now he hath leiſure to look a little about him, and finds himſelf in a bad caſe, having no courſe left, but either to return to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and confeſſing his Folly, implore his Compaſſion; or to put himſelf a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to a Stranger, thereby to get a mean lively-hood; the former of theſe he was yet loath to come to, having not as he thought tryed ſufficiently the folly of his own counſel, and to take to himſelf the ſhame of his own ill conduct, by ſo plain a retreat, was thought a ſharper calamity than any he yet felt; therefore he reſolves upon the latter, as if the ſeverities of a ſtranger were more tolerable than the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches of a Father: For he concluded, a man was not perfectly Miſerable that had no body to upbraid his Folly. And now being in a ſtrange Countrey, he comforted himſelf with this, that if he ſhould find none to pity him, he was ſure there would
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:59886:81"/>be none could torture him with the grating remembrance of what he was and might have been. <hi>Well,</hi> he becomes a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, and he that could not brook the grave reſtraint of paternal Authority, now feels the heavy yoke of ſervile obedience; for he is put to the baſe drudgery of feeding Swine, and hath the courſeſt fare for his maintenance: the Swine and the Servant feed alike upon Husks, only with this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, ſome body cares for the Hogs, but no body for the Slave; and the former have enough of that which agrees with them, but the latter is pinched with hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, having not allowance of that ſordid diet anſwerable to the importunity of his needs. Being ſorely afflicted with this, he that formerly dreamed of nothing but the ſweets of liberty, and the ſurfeits of volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſneſs, and never once thought of thoſe hungry Wolves, <hi>Want</hi> and <hi>Neceſſity,</hi> which now ſtand at his door, after many a ſad ſigh, diſcourſes thus with himſelf:</q> 
                     <hi>Ah fool that I was, who knew not when I was well, that underſtood not contentment without ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, nor could take up with the ſubſtance, but muſt graſp at ſhadows till I loſt both; that knew not what it was to be happy, but by the ſad experiment of becoming miſerable, that could not diſtinguiſh between the chaſtiſements
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:59886:82"/>of a Father, and the wounds of an enemy, nor believe but all yokes were equal, until I was convinced by tryal, that could not brook the Government and reſtraints of my Fathers Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, though indeared by the reverence of my relation, and ſweetned by the benignity of his countenance, and liberal proviſion for all neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity and delight; nor be ſatisfied of my Fathers wiſdom, but by the effects of my own raſhneſs and folly. Time was when I had the reſpect and dignity of a Son at home, who now find the contempt of a Servant abroad. I was then put to no drudgery, nor had other task than to ſerve the honour and intereſt of my Father, and in ſo doing I conſulted alſo my own; for my duty and my happineſs were then united, but I am now put to the baſeſt office, to the vileſt employment, as if my drudgery were not ſo much impoſed in order to my Maſter's profit, as to my own contumely. But that which comes nearer to me yet, and pinches me very ſore, is, that whereas in my Fathers Houſe I could nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther feel nor fear want, I can now hope for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe; there the meaneſt ſervant had bread, not only to the full, but to ſuperfluity; much leſs was any thing wanting to me then a Son; now the caſe is ſadly altered, I that ſeldom had ſo much hunger as might ſerve for ſauce, to the plenty of my Fathers Table, feel now the difference between the liberal hand of a
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:59886:82"/>Father, and the evil and nigardly eye of a hard Maſter. Oh the difference between the ſweet fumes of</hi> Plenty, <hi>and the gnawing pains of</hi> Wind <hi>and</hi> Emptineſs!</p>

                     <hi>Ah fellow Companions! what would I give now for what I have formerly waſted or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed! then I loathed wholſom food, and now feed upon Husks; how do I now envy the meaneſt ſervant in my Father's Houſe: they have enough of all things, and I the want of all things; they ſurfeit, I ſtarve. But alas, it is to no purpoſe to complain here, the Swine I feed cannot pity me, and the Maſter I ſerve will not: There is no other choice left me now, but I muſt return to my Father or periſh; little did I think what would come of it when I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook him, and perhaps little does he think what I have ſuffered ſince: If my ſufferings have brought down my proud Heart, and taught me ſubmiſſion, it may be, my deplorable condition may move his Bowels; it is true, he caſt me not out, but I forſook and abandoned him: My Youthful heat and folly precipitated me upon my own Ruine, but as he hath more Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom than I, ſo perhaps the Affections of a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are more ſtrong than thoſe of a Child; and the more he ſees my Fooliſhneſs, the more Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments he will find to ſhew me Mercy; at leaſt, I will make tryal of his Clemency, I will humbly proſtrate my ſelf before him, I'le em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace thoſe Knees that Educated me, I'le lick the duſt of that Threſhold which I contemptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly forſook, I'le own my fault, and take ſhame to my ſelf, and ſo both magnifie his Mercy if
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:59886:83"/>he receive me, and juſtifie his proceedings if he reject me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I know my Father is ſubject or obnoxious to no body, who ſhall blame him for Pardoning, or ſet limits to his Mercy? nay, who can tell the meaſure of a Fathers Bowels? It may be too there is irreſiſtible Eloquence in Miſery, and the ſpectacle of a Sons</hi> Adverſity <hi>may have Rhetorick enough in it to carry the cauſe where a Father is Judge. Or if he, provoked by my Folly at firſt, and Extravagancies ſince, will no more own me as a Son, perhaps he may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive me as a Servant; for if my Rebellion hath extinguiſhed in him the peculiar Affections of a Father, yet it hath not deſtroyed the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Paſſions of Humanity, Mercy, and Pity; if he will receive me in that lower quality, I am now broken to the condition of a Servant, and ſhall think his Yoke eaſie hereafter, having been inured to ſo ſharp and heavy an one; I will chearfully ſubmit my Ear to be boared to his Door-poſt, and be his Servant for ever.</hi>

But if all fail, and he ſhould utterly caſt me off (which yet I hope he

                     <hi>Well,</hi> this being reſolved, he caſts a <hi>long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing look</hi> towards his Fathers Houſe, and puts himſelf on his way thither: But no ſooner was he on his way, (though yet a great way off) but his Father ſpies him: Thoſe lean and wan Cheeks, and the hollow ſunken Eyes his Extremity had reduced him to, had not ſo disfigured him, nor thoſe Rags un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to cover his Nakedneſs, ſo diſguiſed him, but his Father knew him; and the memory of his former Diſobedience had not ſo Cancelled the Intereſts of a Son, or ſhut up the Bowels of a Father, but that the ſight of his preſent Miſery kindled his Compaſſion. And whilſt the Son, partly through that weakneſs which his Vices and his Sufferings had conſpired to bring upon him, and partly through a combination of ſhame and juſt fear of his Fathers Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with difficulty makes towards him; the Father, prompted by Paternal Affection, and tranſported between Joy and Pity, runs to meet him, <hi>falls on his Neck, and kiſſes him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now ſee what Entertainment his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gives him being come into his Preſence. He calls for a Robe; yea, the beſt Robe, and ſo Cloaths him; for a Ring to adorn
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:59886:84"/>and beautifie him; for Shoes for his Feet, that ſtones might not annoy nor hurt them; for the fat Calf, to feed and refreſh him; and whatſoever is wanting he beſtows upon him. Now, had the Father fit time, and his Sons ſins deſerved it, that he ſhould rip up unto him his former faults, and call to remembrance the Offences of his Youth, and welcom him home after this manner: <hi>Ah, Sirra, are you now come, is all ſpent amongſt your Whores and Harlots? Return unto them, let them provide for you, come you no more within my Doors.</hi> But behold the love of this his Father, he uſeth no ſuch thundring ſpeeches, he threatneth not to caſt him off, nor yet doth he caſt him in the teeth with his former Courſes; he remembreth not any old Reckonings, the Offences of his Youth are not ſpoken of: But he (ſeeing this his Riotous and unthrifty Son return home with an humble Heart) preſently offers himſelf to his Child, and before he had made an end of his Confeſſion, or could beg a ſupply of things needful, his Father intercepts him by his haſty calling to his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, <hi>Bring hither the beſt Robe, the Shoes, the Ring, let the fat Calf be killed, make a Feaſt, ſend for Muſick; let all be forgotten that is paſt; let my Sons old Courſes no more be remembred.</hi>

                  <p>The Son, though aſtoniſhed at this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcention, and ſurprized with the unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected benignity of ſuch a Reception, yet could not but remember what his Fathers
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:59886:85"/>Joy made him forget; namely, his former Diſ-ingenuity and Rebellion: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore humbly falls on his knees again, and with ſhame and remorſe makes his contrite acknowledgment after this manner. <hi>Father,</hi> (for ſo this admirable goodneſs of yours gives me encouragement to call you, more than the Blood and Life which I derived from you) <hi>I have, I confeſs, forfeited all the Intereſt the Priviledges of my Birth might have afforded me in your Affection, having become a Rebel both towards God and you; had I not firſt neglected him, I am ſure I had never grieved you; and having forſaken you, I have not only violated the greateſt Obligation I had upon me (ſave that to his Divine Majeſty) but alſo deſpiſed and affronted a goodneſs like to his; whatſoever therefore I have ſuffered was but the juſt demerit of my folly and contumacy, and whatſoever Sentence you ſhall paſs upon me further I will willingly ſubmit to, and here expect my doom from you: I condemn my ſelf, as no more worthy to be called your Son, be pleaſed to admit me but into the condition of your meaneſt Servant, and I have more than my miſcarriages give me reaſon to hope for.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whilſt the Son was going on at this rate, the Fathers Bowels yearned too earneſtly to admit of the delay of long Apologies, and therefore chuſes rather to interrupt him in
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:59886:86"/>his Diſcourſe, than to adjourn his own Joys or the others comfort: And becauſe he thought words not ſufficient in this caſe, he makes deeds the Interpreters of his mind, commanding his Servants forthwith, <hi>to bring out the beſt Robe, and to put it upon his Son, together with a Ring on his Hand, and Shoes on his Feet, i.e.</hi> in all points to Habit him as his Son, and as a Son of ſuch a Father; by all which he maketh the full demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a perfect Reconciliation; and not content herewith, to give vent to his Joy, that it might not overpower him whilſt he confined it to his own boſom, and perhaps alſo that thoſe who had ſhared with him in his ſorrows for the loſs of a beloved Son, might participate alſo in the joy of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery; he goes on, <hi>bring out alſo the fatted Calf, and kill it, and let us eat and be merry; for this my Son was dead, and is alive again, was loſt and is found; and they began to be merry.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the midſt of this extraordinary Jollity it happens the Elder Son, who had always continued in his Duty towards his Father, comes out of the Fields, where he had been Negotiating his Fathers Affairs, and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders at the unuſual <hi>Jubilee:</hi> And when (de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding the occaſion) they of the Family had made him acquainted with the whole
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:59886:86"/>matter, he takes it ill, and interpreting this marvellous tranſport of Joy at his Brothers return, to be in derogation from himſelf; as if his Father was too eaſie and inclinable towards him, but ſevere to himſelf, and unmind ful of the long and faithful Service he had done him, begins to Expoſtulate the matter ſomewhat warmly with his Father; but the good Old Man mildly replies: Son, I am very ſenſible of, and ſet a juſt value upon the long courſe of your Obedience, and I have it both in my Power, and in my Will to Reward you. 'Tis true, I have not hitherto made ſuch Solemn expreſſions of my Love to you, as I have now done upon this Occaſion, for the caſe did not require it; you, as you have been always Dutiful to me, ſo you have had my Houſe and all I have conſtantly to accommodate you; as you have never Rebelled againſt me, ſo you have never felt the hardſhips your Poor Brother hath undergone by his Fooliſhneſs; and as you that have never offended me, never could diſtruſt my Favour, nor need not ſuch demonſtrations of my Reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, which this former Guilt and Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagancies of your now Penitent Brother renders neceſſary in his caſe; ſo alſo was I never over-whelmed with Grief for you who were never loſt; but foraſmuch as we

                  </p>
                  <p>But I will now Paraphraſe no longer upon the Parable it ſelf, but proceed to the next Verſe in my Text, which containeth in it the purpoſe and reſolution which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal Son had in his Heart, upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of his ſad and deſperate Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I will ariſe and go to my Father, and will ſay unto him, Father, I have ſinned againſt Heaven, and before thee,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And am no more worthy to be called thy Son, make me as one of thy hired Servants.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the former Verſe we have this Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal in his deep Meditations, comparing things together, and weighing them in the Balance: But behold, whilſt he muſed, the fire kindled in his boſom, and now he ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>I will ariſe and go to my Father, and will ſay unto him, Father, I have ſinned,</hi> &amp;c. In the words theſe three ſpecials are obſerved: <hi>Firſt,</hi> What he reſolves to do, <hi>I will ariſe. Secondly,</hi> To whom he will go, <hi>viz. to my Father. Thirdly,</hi> What he will ſay, <hi>Father, I have ſinned.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:59886:88"/>
                  <p>It was high time for the <hi>Prodigal</hi> to think of returning to his Father, when he was periſhing by his Diſobedience, and had no further refuge but in his Fathers Clemency; and ſure it is time for the ſinner to Repent and return to God, when (if he be ſenſible of any thing) he cannot but be apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive that in the courſe he is in, the danger of his Eternal Ruine is as certainly impendent as it is more intolerable.</p>
                  <p>But now to come to the particulars: And firſt, we are to conſider what he reſolves to do: <hi>I will</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ariſe and go,</hi> &amp;c. There is a three-fold Reſurrection of a Chriſtian. The firſt is <hi>Sacramental,</hi> and thus we riſe again in Baptiſm: The ſecond is <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral,</hi> and ſo we ſhall riſe again in the day of the Lord Jeſus, in our Bodies from the Grave: The third is <hi>Spiritual,</hi> which is his Reſurrection in this Life in Soul, from the death of ſin: Thus did this Prodigal ariſe, and thus doth every true Penitent ariſe, while he here liveth on the Earth. The point may be this:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That Repentance from ſin, is as a Reſurrection from death;</hi> this is plain by the Apoſtles words, <hi>Awake, thou that ſleepeſt, ſtand up from the dead, and Chriſt ſhall give thee light.</hi>
                  </p>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. Is this ſo, then Repentance is no ſuch eaſie a matter, as the World takes it to be, the work of Repentance is no leſs Miraculous than the raiſing of the dead; it is a work that cannot be wrought by the power of Nature, but ſuch a work as muſt be wrought by the mighty Power of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. And that ſhall be, to ſtir us all up thus to ariſe; for if the Soul while it is in the Body, ariſe not out of the Grave of ſin, ſure it is, the Body ſhall never riſe out of the Earth, but to ſhame and confuſion; uſe all good means therefore, that thou mayeſt have thy part in this, that ſo the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond death may have no power on thee, for otherwiſe it is impoſſible to eſcape the power of it, by no means canſt thou eſcape the pains of Hell Torments, if thou doſt not here awake, ſtand up from the dead, and with <hi>Lazarus</hi> come forth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And goe.]</hi> It was a good and Holy mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which he had of ariſing, this he doth not quench, but cheriſheth and nouriſheth it; he adds more fewel to this fire begun, though but a ſpark; to the good motion of ariſing, he adds the ſecond of going. <hi>I will ariſe and go.</hi> Firſt then learn:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The good motions of Gods Bleſſed Spirit, at any time, in any meaſure (though never ſo weak) begun; are not to be choaked, but to be
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:59886:89"/>cheriſhed.</hi> When the Lord ſhall put any good motion into our Hearts, we are to nouriſh and cheriſh the ſame; to one good motion we muſt add a ſecond, and to that a third, and to them many more; and ſo fall to blowing, and give not over until at length they break forth into a comfortable flame of Godly Practiſe.</p>
                  <p>He brings a forcible Reaſon. <hi>Whereby you are ſealed unto the day of Redemption:</hi> This is the only Evidence we have of freedom from Condemnation; this is Gods Mark and Character ſet on us, and ſeizing us for his own: This is like the Blood that was ſtricken upon the door-poſts, which ſhall make the Lord to paſs over us, and not to ſuffer the Deſtroyer to come near us, when he goeth to ſmite the <hi>Egyptians.</hi> By this we are aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, that the day of Judgment ſhall be to us no day of wrath, but a day of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption. Thus we have ſeen the Point proved. Now it remains to apply it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And firſt,</hi> this ſerveth then to condemn ſuch as nip the bud ſo ſoon as ever it peeps forth, and quench every ſpark that at any time appeareth; yea, wilfully ſet themſelves to repell all good motions, haſting to their curſed Company, to chaſe away thoſe (which they call (profanely) qualms of Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,) ſweet inſpirements of Gods Holy
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:59886:90"/>Spirit. So ſome have ſome kind of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe wrought at ſome times upon the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Sermon, and ſeem to be much grieved, and are a while perplexed; but they ſoon quench this grief, being not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to <hi>torment</hi> themſelves <hi>before the time,</hi> and therefore run into merry Company, and drink down ſorrow, not being willing to be overmuch diſquieted with this melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly.</p>
                  <p>And therefore in the next place, let it ſerve for Admonition to thee and me, and to us all, that we beware how we ſuffer that bleſſed heat to ſlake, which by Gods grace begins to be enkindled in our Hearts: Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer not that coal, that holy motion which the Lord hath caſt into thy boſom, to die within thee, but blow it up, lay on more fuel, add daily more and more matter to it, and tremble to loſe the leaſt meaſure of Gods gracious gifts: Be frequent in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual exerciſes, as in Hearing, Reading, Meditation, Chriſtian Conference, Prayer, and the like: Let no means be neglected, that God hath ordained for the working of eſtabliſhment.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond Doctrine, that may hence be gathered, is this; <hi>Where ſpiritual life and new birth is once begun, there will be a growth and an increaſe in Grace.</hi> There will be no
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:59886:90"/>ſtanding at a ſtay, but a proceeding by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees: After a riſing there will be a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>Firſt then, let this ſerve for Examination; Try thy ſelf hereby, ſee what growth of Grace is in thee, what increaſe of Faith, Love, Zeal, Patience; and what ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the inward man: Doth Grace get more ſtrength every day than other? Doth it grow to ſome bigneſs? Doth it ſhoot up in tallneſs, and ſtature? Surely then it is out of Queſtion, that Grace is true Grace, and thou art made partaker of the New Birth: But doth it remain ſtill Infant-like, and feeble, without any ſtirring or ſhewing of it ſelf? Then haſt thou cauſe to fear, it is but the counterfeit, and not true Grace in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed; the withering of the blade is a ſhrewd ſign of a ſtony ground.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, this may ſerve to Reprove ſuch as ſtand at a ſtay, and go not forward; but are like the <hi>George</hi> on Horſe-back, ever riding, but never go a ſtep further: Where you leave them this Year, there you may find them the next. This is a fearful ſign, and a moſt uncomfortable thing.</p>
                  <p>In the third place, let this Admoniſh every one to grow in Grace, <hi>Let us forget that which is behind, and endeavour to that which is before; let us preſs hard towards the Mark<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        <pb n="138" facs="tcp:59886:91"/>for the price of the high calling of God.</hi> Let us not be evermore as <hi>ſmoaking Flax,</hi> or <hi>bruiſed Reeds,</hi> or as new ſet <hi>Plants,</hi> but let us abound more and more.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To my Father<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi>] Not to my Brother, or Fathers Servants, or to my Harlots: But to my Father. Hence learn:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Relief is to be ſought for only at Gods hands in time of Miſery and Diſtreſs.</hi> To him are we to betake our ſelves, and to none but him.</p>
                  <p>Let this ſerve to Reprove ſuch as betake themſelves to other helps in time of Miſery, ſeeking to be relieved, either by Saints or Angels in Heaven; or by <hi>Conjurers, Witches,</hi> or ſuch like unlawful means here upon the Earth. This was King <hi>Ahaziah</hi>'s ſin, who being ſick, <hi>ſent Meſſengers, and ſaid unto them, Go enquire of</hi> Baal-zebub <hi>the God of</hi> Ekron, <hi>whether I ſhall recover of this Diſeaſe:</hi> contrary to that charge which God doth give his People. <hi>Regard not them that have Familiar Spirits; neither ſeek after Wizards, to be defiled by them: I am the Lord your God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, let this teach us to betake our ſelves unto the Lord, when ſorrows and griefs aſſails us. Seek help from him, and that by means, yet only by ſuch Lawful means as he hath warranted in his Word;
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:59886:91"/>and beware of truſting in the means that God hath warranted. It is Lawful to ſeek to the Phyſitian, and uſe of his help, yet to truſt in the help of the Phyſitian more than in the help of God, and to ſeek firſt and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the Phyſitian than unto God, is ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And ſay unto him, Father</hi>] He doth here fore-think what he ſhould ſpeak when as he comes into his Fathers preſence (for as yet he was not.) From his Practiſe learn,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Not to come into Gods preſence without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration,</hi> but conſider what to ſay, and what to ſeek, before you ſpeak.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Be not raſh</hi> (ſaith the Wiſe man) <hi>with thy mouth, and let not thine heart be haſty to utter any thing before God.</hi> We muſt confer with our own Hearts, and prepare them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we come into the Lords preſence. To this, doth the Prophet <hi>Hoſea</hi> ſeem to exhort <hi>Iſrael, Take unto you words, and turn to the Lord, and ſay unto him.</hi> And ſo our Saviour in his direction for Prayer, ſets not down the Petitions abruptly, but beginneth with a Solemn <hi>Preface,</hi> to ſhew that before we Pray, there ought to be a diſpoſition of our ſelves, and compoſſng of the <hi>Affections</hi> to the Duty. So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 108.10. <hi>&amp;</hi> 57.7, 8.</p>
                  <pb n="140" facs="tcp:59886:92"/>
                  <p>The Reaſons of this, <hi>Solomon</hi> gives in the place before cited: <hi>For firſt, God</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is in Heaven:</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, God is full of Majeſty and Wiſdom: He is both Lord and Judge; it is not a Man, nor an Earthly Power that you have to deal with, but that God who hath the <hi>Angels</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending on him, and a thouſand times ten thouſands of Angels adminiſtring unto him; at whoſe feet all Kings on Earth caſt down their Crowns and Scepters.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>thou art upon the Earth, i. e.</hi> a weak, unwiſe, unworthy Creature, infinitely inferiour in degree unto thy Creator: And therefore it becomes not thee to ſpeak unto him but with the greateſt Fear, Reverence, and Adviſedneſs.</p>
                  <p>And therefore Firſt, this ſerves to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove many, who raſhly come into Gods preſence without any preparation, or due meditation of what they are to ſay or crave. Small is the number indeed of ſuch as do Pray, but ſmaller is the number indeed of ſuch as prepare themſelves to Pray.</p>
                  <p>In the Second place, let this Admoniſh us to prepare our ſelves, before we come to appear before the Lord, to call upon his Name, whether in Publick or Private. You know, Goodly Buildings have ſome Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence in the Gate, and great Perſonages
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:59886:92"/>have ſeemly Uſhers to go before them, who by their uncovered Heads, command reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and way: So ſhould Holy Duties be undertaken, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19.10. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.5. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19.3.</p>
                  <p>And thus much may be ſpoken of this point: We are now to ſpeak of the words themſelves, which he deviſed to ſpeak.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Father, I have ſinned, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In theſe words of his acknowledgment, we may ſee what it was eſpecially that touched him to the quick; namely this, that he had abuſed and wronged the love and kindneſs of ſo good a Father. This was that which made him ſo much to inſiſt upon the name of <hi>[Father.]</hi> I will go to my <hi>[Father:]</hi> I will ſay <hi>[Father.]</hi> The mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery that he was in (as his want of Bread and other Neceſſaries) no doubt was grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous; yet all this troubled him not ſo much as this, that he had carried himſelf ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dutifully towards ſo gracious a Parent. Let this then be noted:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That nothing is ſo grievous to a true Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, as this, that by committing of ſin, he hath offended God.</hi> This was that which moſt troubled <hi>David,</hi> and went nigheſt to his Soul, that he had ſinned againſt the Lord, and offended his Majeſty by his committing of evil. <hi>Againſt thee, againſt thee only have
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:59886:93"/>I ſinned, and done this evil in thy ſight.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Reaſon of this, the Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul</hi> giveth. <hi>They have not received the ſpirit of Bondage again to fear, but they have received the ſpirit of Adoption:</hi> Which Spirit doth make them love the Lord, and fear to offend, and exceedingly grieve when he is offended: As it is with a true Lover towards his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved.</p>
                  <p>Now for the Uſes; and firſt, we may ſee here a difference between the ſorrow of the Godly and of the Wicked: Both grieve, both mourn. <hi>Ahab</hi> as well as <hi>David. Judas</hi> as well as <hi>Peter.</hi> Yet the ſorrow of the one is Godly, and bringeth Life; the ſorrow of the other Worldly, and bringeth Death.</p>
                  <p>And therefore for thy further eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, know, if thou doſt truly grieve, theſe things ſhalt thou find in thee.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, thou wilt grieve for ſins of all <hi>ſorts,</hi> Original and Actual; of Ignorance, and of Knowledge; of Commiſſion, and of Omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; Secret and Open; for leſs as well as for bigger; whatſoever is ſin thou wilt mourn for, becauſe Gods Law is by it broken, and ſo his Majeſty is offended.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If thou grieveſt becauſe God is offended, then wilt thou grieve alſo for the ſins of others, as well as for thy own, becauſe God is diſhonoured by the one as well as by the other.</p>
                  <pb n="143" facs="tcp:59886:93"/>
                  <p>Thirdly, if thy ſorrow be right, it will be a <hi>Proportional Sorrow.</hi> A Sorrow anſwerable to the ſin, as we ſee in <hi>Manaſſes,</hi> his ſin was great, and his Contrition was great, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 33.12. So in <hi>Peter,</hi> his ſorrow was great for denying his Maſter, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.75.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, If thy Sorrow be Godly, and is for ſin as it is an offence againſt God, thou wilt then be more deſirous to be rid of ſin, than of any other croſs whatſoever; yea, as heartily deſirous never to commit it, as thou art deſirous that God would never impute it.</p>
                  <p>Now in the Second place, this may ſerve for the Reproof, yea, for the terror of many, who reſt in a counterfeit and unſound Repentance. For, doth a true Penitent grieve more for Gods cauſe than for his own? Is he more grieved for the offence againſt God, than for any manner of reſpect unto himſelf? Then ſurely ſuch are far from true Repentance, who (were it not for fear or ſhame) could be content to live in ſin, and tumble in it all their days.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And before thee]</hi> That is, in thy ſight, as afterwards, Verſe 21. This did add much unto his ſorrow, and did very much aggravate his fault. Two Points are here to be obſerved:</p>
                  <p>The firſt is this, <hi>That Gods Eye is on all mens Actions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="144" facs="tcp:59886:94"/>
                  <p>The ſecond is this, <hi>The forgetting of Gods All-ſeeing Eye in the committing of evil, doth aggravate the ſin, and increaſe the ſame.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To come then to the Reaſons:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, God is every where preſent, he can be ſhut out of no place, as man can, or as the Sun can; becauſe he is infinite in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. <hi>Do not I fill Heaven and Earth,</hi> ſaith the Lord? <hi>Am I a God at hand, and not afar off?</hi> And therefore it cannot otherwiſe be, but he muſt needs behold our doings, and our actions, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.7. <hi>Acts</hi> 17.27.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It is he that made <hi>the Eye, and ſhall he not ſee? It is he that made the Ear, and ſhall he not hear?</hi> He giveth knowledge, and ſhall he not know? Can any thing be hid from him from whom they have their being? The work is known unto the worker, the Art unto the Artificer, the Pot unto the Potter: And ſhall not the Creature be known unto the Creator?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>He it is that chaſtiſeth the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> (as the Prophet ſpeaks in the ſame Pſalm, Verſe 10.) <hi>ſhall not he correct?</hi> He ſhall be the Judge; every one ſhall be Judged by him, according to his works: Now, albeit he ſhall not want Witneſſes at that day, yet it is fitting that himſelf ſhould have knowledge of the Actions of all men, ſeeing
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:59886:94"/>
                     <hi>he will not reprove after the hearing of his Ears, Iſa.</hi> 11.3. Theſe Reaſons ſhall ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice inſtead of many. Now for the Uſes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. And firſt, this may ſerve for Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror to all ſuch as live in ſin; what greater terror to a Thief, than to have the Judge an Eye-witneſs of his Villany? So what greater terror to the wicked than this, to have the Lord behold their doings.</p>
                  <p>Oh think on theſe things, you lurking <hi>Dans,</hi> cloſe Enemies of the Church, <hi>whoſe ſleep departs from you, till you have cauſed ſome to fall:</hi> The Lord ſeeth your Plots and cunning Devices, your cloſe Practiſes againſt his Church and People; <hi>But he that ſitteth in Heaven ſhall laugh you to ſcorn, the Lord will have you in deriſion.</hi> Take notice of this alſo, you Adulterers and Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongers, who ſay in your Hearts, <hi>Who ſeeth us?</hi> We are compaſſed about with dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, we need not fear: Behold, the Lord himſelf, who ſhall be thy Judge, he ſeeth thy Villany, and looketh thee in the Face, in the Act doing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. Secondly, this ſerveth to ſet forth Gods wonderful Patience, and long-ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: For, is all ſin in his Eye? Then won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at Gods forbearance! who ſeeing ſo many and outragious ſins daily committed, yet for all that, ſpares us. Some are Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:59886:95"/>ſome Tipling, ſome Cheating, ſome Whoring, when his Eye is on them: All our Impurities, Impieties, he doth plainly behold, yet he forbears and doth not ſtrike: Wonder at this, wonder at it, Oh you Sons of Men, and let it teach you to Repent.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 3. A Third Uſe may ſerve to ſtir us up, and encourage us to well-doing, what lazie Servant will not put forth his ſtrength when his Maſters Eye is on him? So, who is it (were he well perſwaded that the Lord is a ſpectator and beholder of his doings) would not put forth his ſtrength to the Lords work? Were this well conſidered, how couragious ſhould we be, both in the Duties of our general and ſpecial Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings?</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Doctrine hence to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, is this:</p>
                  <q>That the forgetting of Gods All-ſeeing Eye in the committing of evil, doth aggravate the ſin, and increaſe the ſame.</q>
                  <p>The Reaſons of this Point are theſe. Firſt, we ſin againſt the means that ought to keep us from ſin, and this doth aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate the ſin exceedingly, and make ſin out of meaſure ſinful.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, we rob God of his Honour, and give not that unto him which is his right, we would pluck out his Eyes that he
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:59886:95"/>ſhould not ſee, or at leaſt, judge him to be blind: To think God ſeeth us not, is a kind of Atheiſm, for after a ſort, we deny him to be God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And am no more worthy to be called thy Son.]</hi> See how he humbleth and abaſeth himſelf, even to the uttermoſt. I am not worthy to be thy Son, nay, not worthy of the name of a Son, make me but as an hired Servant, and I ſhall think my ſelf moſt happy. Oh rare Humility! yet greatly neceſſary, becauſe God is good to ſuch. But, as for the Proud, he beholds them afar off. But to come to the Leſſon, and this it is; <hi>Where there is true Repentance, there is a ſight and ſenſe of a mans own unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And it ſtands with good Reaſon; for the Affections muſt needs follow the tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Mind; ſo that as the conceit of Holineſs and Happineſs doth puff up a Man in Pride and Preſumption, ſo the true ſight and ſenſe of his ſinful and wretched eſtate, muſt needs caſt him down with ſhame and ſorrow.</p>
                  <p>Let us then examine our Repentance by our Humility. Haſt thou truly Repented? Then thou art truly Humbled, and caſt down with a ſight and ſenſe of thy ſins and tranſgreſſions.</p>
                  <pb n="148" facs="tcp:59886:96"/>
                  <p>But in the ſecond place I muſt fall from Exhorting to Lamenting; for certainly there is but ſmall ſtore of true Repentance upon the Earth, there is ſo little Humility among Men and Women.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, this may ſerve for <hi>Terror</hi> to all ſuch, who as yet have not this mean and baſe eſteem of themſelves. Let all ſuch know they are void of Grace: I have Gods Word for my Warrant. <hi>Behold</hi> (ſaith the Prophet) <hi>his Soul which is lifted up, is not upright within him.</hi> All thoſe that are void of Humility are far from uprightneſs: The higher the Sun is, the ſhorter is the ſhadow; the more grace, the leſs conceit: The empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Veſſel ever ſounds loudeſt, and the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler the leſs. Wood that in burning yields the greateſt ſmoak, doth commonly give the ſmalleſt heat. Thoſe boughs which are moſt laden with Fruit, thoſe ears which are fulleſt of Corn, do ever bend downward; when the barren bough, and empty ear ſtands upright: So thoſe that are emptieſt of Grace, evermore make the greateſt oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and crack moſt of their own good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Make me as one of thy hired Servants.]</hi> As if he ſhould have ſaid, I dare not, I do not make ſuit to be as before I was, a Son; I am unworthy of ſuch favour, yet vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:59886:96"/>me that favour that I may belong unto thee; and although I am not worthy to be called a Son, yet vouchſafe me to be a hanger-on; let me have a Room and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in thy Houſe, though it be amongſt the company of thy hired Servants.</p>
                  <p>Here we ſee the caſe is altered; while he was in the Houſe no place was good enough for him; but now that he hath been a while in a far Countrey, and wanted of that Bread which his Fathers Servants had, he doth deſire to be in the baſeſt Office.</p>
                  <p>This teacheth us this Leſſon; <hi>Gods bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings are better known, and more eſteemed by the wanting of them, than by their enjoying.</hi> The worth and value of Gods good Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings are not known till we be without them. Thus Viſion was precious in the days of <hi>Ely,</hi> when that was wanting. And the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> telleth the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that the <hi>bleſſings of the Lord ſhould be excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and pleaſant to them, after they had been pinched with the want thereof in their Captivity;</hi> yea, the bud ſhall then be beautiful, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Uſe of this (in a word) is, to teach us to eſteem more of the good Bleſſings we receive from God, and beware of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuing them, leſt we give the Lord occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to deprive us of them. Theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:59886:97"/>bleſſings of the ſhining of the Sun, breathing in the Air, Meat, Drink, preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation in our going out, in our coming in, uſe of the Senſes, ſtrength of Body, and the like, let them be more eſteemed of thee; alas, conſider how miſerable thou art with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out theſe! The Lord is fain (ſo great is his Mercy, and our Corruption) to deprive his Children of many of theſe good <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">

                  <p>And therefore Firſt, this ſerves to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove many, who rainy come into Gods preſence without any preparation, or due meditation of what they are to ſay or crave.

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. And firſt, this may ſerve for Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror to all ſuch as live in ſin; what greater terror to a Thief, than to have the Judge an Eye-witneſs of his Villany? So what greater terror to the wicked than this, to have the Lord behold their doings.</p>
                  <p>Oh think on theſe things, you lurking <hi>Dans,</hi> cloſe Enemies of the Church, <hi>whoſe ſleep departs from you, till you have cauſed ſome to fall:</hi> The Lord ſeeth your Plots and cunning Devices, your cloſe Practiſes againſt his Church and People; <hi>But he that ſitteth in Heaven ſhall laugh you to ſcorn, the Lord will have you in deriſion.</hi> Take notice of this alſo, you Adulterers and Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongers, who ſay in your Hearts, <hi>Who ſeeth us?</hi> We are compaſſed about with dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, we need not fear: Behold, the Lord himſelf, who ſhall be thy Judge, he ſeeth thy Villany, and looketh thee in the Face, in the Act doing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. Secondly, this ſerveth to ſet forth Gods wonderful Patience, and long-ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: For, is all ſin in his Eye? Then won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at Gods forbearance! who ſeeing ſo many and outragious ſins daily committed, yet for all that, ſpares us. Some are Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:59886:100"/>ſome Tipling, ſome Cheating, ſome Whoring, when his Eye is on them: All our Impurities, Impieties, he doth plainly behold, yet he forbears and doth not ſtrike: Wonder at this, wonder at it, Oh you Sons of Men, and let it teach you to Repent.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 3. A Third Uſe may ſerve to ſtir us up, and encourage us to well-doing, what lazie Servant will not put forth his ſtrength when his Maſters Eye is on him? So, who is it (were he well perſwaded that the Lord is a ſpectator and beholder of his doings) would not put forth his ſtrength to the Lords work? Were this well conſidered, how couragious ſhould we be, both in the Duties of our general and ſpecial Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings?</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Doctrine hence to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, is this:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That the forgetting of Gods All-ſeeing Eye in the committing of evil, doth aggravate the ſin, and increaſe the ſame.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Reaſons of this Point are theſe. Firſt, we ſin againſt the means that ought to keep us from ſin, and this doth aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate the ſin exceedingly, and make ſin out of meaſure ſinful.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, we rob God of his Honour, and give not that unto him which is his right, we would pluck out his Eyes that he
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:59886:100"/>ſhould not ſee, or at leaſt, judge him to be blind: To think God ſeeth us not, is a kind of Atheiſm, for after a ſort, we deny him to be God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And am no more worthy to be called thy Son.]</hi> See how he humbleth and abaſeth himſelf, even to the uttermoſt. I am not worthy to be thy Son, nay, not worthy of the name of a Son, make me but as an hired Servant, and I ſhall think my ſelf moſt happy. Oh rare Humility! yet greatly neceſſary, becauſe God is good to ſuch. But, as for the Proud, he beholds them afar off. But to come to the Leſſon, and this it is; <hi>Where there is true Repentance, there is a ſight and ſenſe of a mans own unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And it ſtands with good Reaſon; for the Affections muſt needs follow the tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Mind; ſo that as the conceit of Holineſs and Happineſs doth puff up a Man in Pride and Preſumption, ſo the true ſight and ſenſe of his ſinful and wretched eſtate, muſt needs caſt him down with ſhame and ſorrow.</p>
                  <p>Let us then examine our Repentance by our Humility. Haſt thou truly Repented? Then thou art truly Humbled, and caſt down with a ſight and ſenſe of thy ſins and tranſgreſſions.</p>
                  <pb n="148" facs="tcp:59886:101"/>
                  <p>But in the ſecond place I muſt fall from Exhorting to Lamenting; for certainly there is but ſmall ſtore of true Repentance upon the Earth, there is ſo little Humility among Men and Women.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, this may ſerve for <hi>Terror</hi> to all ſuch, who as yet have not this mean and baſe eſteem of themſelves. Let all ſuch know they are void of Grace: I have Gods Word for my Warrant. <hi>Behold</hi> (ſaith the Prophet) <hi>his Soul which is lifted up, is not upright within him.</hi> All thoſe that are void of Humility are far from uprightneſs: The higher the Sun is, the ſhorter is the ſhadow; the more grace, the leſs conceit: The empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Veſſel ever ſounds loudeſt, and the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler the leſs. Wood that in burning yields the greateſt ſmoak, doth commonly give the ſmalleſt heat. Thoſe boughs which are moſt laden with Fruit, thoſe ears which are fulleſt of Corn, do ever bend downward; when the barren bough, and empty ear ſtands upright: So thoſe that are emptieſt of Grace, evermore make the greateſt oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and crack moſt of their own good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Make me as one of thy hired Servants.]</hi> As if he ſhould have ſaid, I dare not, I do not make ſuit to be as before I was, a Son; I am unworthy of ſuch favour, yet vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:59886:101"/>me that favour that I may belong unto thee; and although I am not worthy to be called a Son, yet vouchſafe me to be a hanger-on; let me have a Room and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in thy Houſe, though it be amongſt the company of thy hired Servants.</p>
                  <p>Here we ſee the caſe is altered; while he was in the Houſe no place was good enough for him; but now that he hath been a while in a far Countrey, and wanted of that Bread which his Fathers Servants had, he doth deſire to be in the baſeſt Office.</p>
                  <p>This teacheth us this Leſſon; <hi>Gods bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings are better known, and more eſteemed by the wanting of them, than by their enjoying.</hi> The worth and value of Gods good Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings are not known till we be without them. Thus Viſion was precious in the days of <hi>Ely,</hi> when that was wanting. And the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> telleth the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that the <hi>bleſſings of the Lord ſhould be excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and pleaſant to them, after they had been pinched with the want thereof in their Captivity;</hi> yea, the bud ſhall then be beautiful, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Uſe of this (in a word) is, to teach us to eſteem more of the good Bleſſings we receive from God, and beware of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuing them, leſt we give the Lord occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to deprive us of them. Theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:59886:102"/>bleſſings of the ſhining of the Sun, breathing in the Air, Meat, Drink, preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation in our going out, in our coming in, uſe of the Senſes, ſtrength of Body, and the like, let them be more eſteemed of thee; alas, conſider how miſerable thou art with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out theſe! The Lord is fain (ſo great is his Mercy, and our Corruption) to deprive his Children of many of theſe good Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, till they know the price and worth of them; and in their reſtraint make them enjoy the ſmalleſt bleſſing more thankfully and comfortably. Hunger is good ſawce, and giveth good reliſh and taſte to courſe Meats and homely Fare, when for want hereof dainty Diſhes are but contemned. Should the Lord deprive thee of thy Health, Strength, Senſe, Sleep, then wouldſt thou ſee what a benefit thou haſt enjoyed. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail therefore thy own corruption in this kind, and pray for this Wiſdom, that thou mayſt rather know the worth of Gods bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings by the enjoying, than by the wanting of them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And he aroſe and came to his Father, &amp;c.</hi>] This Prodigal now puts in Practice what formerly he had reſolved to do. As reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to ariſe: So, <hi>he arofe.</hi> In this his pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe we muſt conſider; Firſt, what he did: Secondly, what he ſaid. For the firſt, the
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:59886:102"/>Text ſaith, <hi>He aroſe and came unto his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> Where we have firſt the parts of his Repentance; which are two, <hi>Averſion</hi> from his ſin, <hi>[He aroſe.]</hi> Secondly, <hi>Converſion</hi> to his God, <hi>And came unto his Father.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, We have to conſider the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance of time when he did it, which is implyed in this word [<hi>And,</hi> or <hi>So,</hi>] that is immediately, he deferred no time, but preſently put in execution what was before but in purpoſe and reſolution.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He aroſe and came to his Father.</hi>] His ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing is nothing elſe but his leaving of ſin (as formerly we have heard) and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his Father, is his turning to the Lord. So then here we have the parts of true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance laid down, which are in number two; firſt, <hi>Averſion from ſin:</hi> Secondly, <hi>Converſion to God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He aroſe</hi>] The point we may obſerve hence, is this:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Where there is true Repentance, there is a riſing from ſin; there is a leaving, and a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking of all former evil ways and courſes.</hi> This point might be confirmed by many Examples: As of <hi>Paul, Peter, Zacheus,</hi> with others, who left their former courſes, and committed them no more.</p>
                  <div type="part">
                     <pb n="152" facs="tcp:59886:103"/>
                     <head>The <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſes follow.</head>
                     <p>Firſt, hereby try thy Repentance, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be good or no: Hath it wrought a change and alteration in thy Affections, Words, and Actions? <hi>Are all old things done away, and new come in the place thereof?</hi> Is there a forſaking of ſin, a reformation of Life? If it be thus, then it is well, for thus it is, and muſt be with every true Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, this may ſerve for terror to ſuch as find no change in themſelves, but are the ſame ſtill that ever they were; of whom it cannot be ſaid, as of the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians, ſuch were you, but now you are changed;</hi> But ſuch are you, and ſo ſtill continue un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed; Adulterers you were, Covetous you were, Drunkards you were, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſo are ſtill; as Proud as ever, as Profane as ever, as Worldly as ever, as irreligious as ever, if not worſe than ever.</p>
                     <p>In the Third place, this may ſerve for the comfort of all ſuch as do find this change in them; who can ſay as that blind man, who had his ſight reſtored, <hi>One thing I know, that whereas I was blind, now I ſee:</hi> Whereas I was filthy and unclean, I am now waſhed and cleanſed: Oh, happy is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:59886:103"/>of ſuch a one! thrice bleſſed is thy Eſtate indeed, only let me admoniſh thee, that thou manifeſt this change unto the World, that others may alſo ſay, <hi>How is this man changed from what he was? Ambroſe</hi> makes Report of a Young Man, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a long time lived in Luſt and Unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, at length Travelled, and in his Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel was Converted: Afterwards returning home, meets with one of his old Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, with whom he had been often naught, but paſſed away, and would not Salute her; at which the Strumpet won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring, ſpeaks to him after this manner; <hi>What, have you forgotten me? It is I:</hi> His Reply unto her again was this; <hi>yea, I know it, but I am not I.</hi> Thus it becomes thee to manifeſt this change thou findeſt to be in thee; that as others have been Witneſſes of thy ſin, ſo they may be alſo Witneſſes of thy Repentance.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And came to his Father</hi>] From hence we learn:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>In true Repentance there is not only a riſing from ſin, but alſo a turning to the Lord, and a ſetting of our hearts towards him and his Kingdom.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Reaſon is this: As by Faith we are ingrafted into Chriſt Jeſus, and ſo made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of his Death, and the power of it,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:59886:104"/>which cauſeth us to die unto ſin: So alſo by the ſame Faith we are made partakers of his Reſurrection, which cauſeth <hi>us to walk in newneſs of Life,</hi> and live unto the Lord. Secondly, the ſame ſpirit that doth cauſe us to leave ſin, doth bring us to the Lord, enabling us to cry, <hi>Abba Father,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> To Reprove many, who will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed confeſs, there muſt be a turning, and will alſo practice a change; but it ſhall be from bad to worſe; from one ſin to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: As for Example; how many do turn from Prodigality to Covetouſneſs? From Swearing to Couſening? From Atheiſm to Popery? From Profaneneſs to Hypocriſie?</p>
                     <p>And if theſe are to be Reproved, then much more are ſuch to be Condemned, who turn from God to Sin; from a Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant to a Papiſt, from a Profeſſor to an Atheiſt. How far are theſe from true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance? What hope can they have, who come ſhort of thoſe that come ſhort of Heaven? Take good notice of this, you that have been forward, and zealous, but now are become Apoſtates and Back-ſliders, and hearken to the Councel given to the Church of <hi>Epheſus, Remember whence thou art fallen, and Repent, and do thy firſt works, or elſe I will come againſt thee quickly, except thou Repent.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="155" facs="tcp:59886:104"/>
                     <p>In the laſt place, let this Admoniſh us, to look that our turning be a true turning: And as by ſin we have departed with this Prodigal from our Fathers Houſe, ſo let us alſo ariſe with him, and ſet forwards to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Heaven.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>So,</hi> or <hi>And</hi>] After this Prodigal had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to go and humble himſelf unto his Father, he did not debate any longer about the matter, but forthwith roſe up and went his way.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Repentance is not to be deferred, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to be ſet upon, ſo ſoon as God ſhall put the motion into our Hearts.</hi> There may not be deferring or procraſtinating, but a ſpeedy practice and execution.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, God is to be ſerved before all: God ever required in his Service the Firſt Fruits, and the Firſt-born: The firſtlings are his Darlings.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, we ought not to defer, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the ſhortneſs and uncertainty of Life. Our Lives they are compared to a <hi>Pilgrimage,</hi> to the <hi>flower of Graſs,</hi> to <hi>Wind,</hi> to <hi>Smoak,</hi> to a <hi>Vapour,</hi> to a <hi>Dream,</hi> and the like: All which ſheweth the ſhortneſs of our time; and therefore our whole Life is little enough to ſpend in Gods Service.</p>
                     <p>But farther, as it is ſhort, ſo alſo it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain. We have no aſſurance to live one
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:59886:105"/>hour; we are here but Tenants at will, and know not how ſoon our great Landlord will turn us out of this earthly Tabernacle: We may be cropt off like an ear of Corn: for what is this life but, as a neſt of ſtraw and clay, ſoon ſhaken a pieces. Many have ſeen a fair bright morning, who never beheld the evening (as the <hi>Sodomites.</hi>) And upon ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the Sun hath ſet in the evening, to whom it never appeared riſing in the morning: So was it with the rich <hi>Glutton</hi> in the Goſpel. Seeing this is ſo, we have great cauſe ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily to repent.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, becauſe for the preſent, thy e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate is fearful, the wrath of God hangs o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thy head by a twined thred, if thou hadſt Eyes to ſee it: thou eateſt in danger of thy life, thou drinkeſt in danger, walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in danger, ſleepeſt in danger, lying be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween death and the Devil, as <hi>Peter</hi> did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two Soldiers, bound with two Chains. Now who would be in ſuch a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger one hour, for the gaining of a World? But we haſten to the Uſes.</p>
                     <p>And firſt: This reproveth that wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful madneſs and exceeding great folly of ſuch as procraſtinate and defer their Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the Lord; and put off their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentnace, though the Lord call them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, and offer them never ſo fit an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity.</p>
                     <pb n="157" facs="tcp:59886:105"/>
                     <p>But, I have time enough to repent in, ſay ſome, what tell you me of Repentance, as yet? Is not God merciful? Did he not ſhew mercy to the Thief at the laſt gaſp? I doubt not but to be ſaved, as well as the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſeſt of you all. But thou who thus goeſt on head-long to Damnation, come hither and let me ſhew thee thy monſtrous folly: that if it be poſſible, thou mayſt be recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out of the ſnare of the Devil, who art thus taken by him at his will. Firſt, thou bleſſeſt thy ſelf with hope of long life, thou wilt repent when thou art old: but how knoweſt thou, that thou ſhalt live till thou comeſt to be old? Doſt not thou ſee, how upon the Stage of this World, ſome have longer parts, and ſome have ſhorter? And as we enter into the Lords Vineyard, do we not ſo go out? that is in ſuch a manner, and at ſuch an hour, ſome in the morning, ſome at noon, ſome at night; ſome die in the dawning of their lives; paſſing from one grave to another, being no ſooner come out of the womb of one Mother, but another Mother receives them into hers: Some die in Youth, as in the third hour, others die at thirty, forty, or fifty, as in the ſixth and ninth hour, and otherſome very old, as in the laſt hour of the day. Now tell me how many die before fifty, for one that live till they be
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:59886:106"/>paſt that age? What hope haſt thou to live till thou beeſt ſo old? Doeſt not thou daily ſee and hear of many that go well out at night, and are found dead in the morning; and of many other, that are ſuddenly ſlain, or come to ſome untimely death: why may it not be thus with thee? how vain then, and falſe is thy hope of long life? ſeeing none can tell what a day, what an hour may bring forth.</p>
                     <p>And Secondly, But ſay thou doſt live till thou beeſt old, and art freed from much of this trouble; having underſtanding, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, ſight, and ſenſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet who can tell whether God will hear thee at the laſt gaſp? For what can be more righteous, than that the Lord ſhould contemn thee at the hour of death, who haſt contemned him in thy whole life?</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, let this admoniſh every one of us to defer no time, but ſpeedily to repent. <hi>Abraham</hi> roſe up betimes to ſacrifice his Son; ſo do thou make haſt to ſacrifice thy ſin. <hi>Zacheus</hi> came down haſtily when he was called, why then do we defer coming to our Saviour? Hearken not to that Crow-crying <hi>cras, cras,</hi> to morrow, to morrow, the voice is diſmal.</p>
                     <p>But now we will proceed to the next words in the Parable.</p>
                     <pb n="159" facs="tcp:59886:106"/>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But when he was yet afar off, his Father ſaw him, and had compaſſion, and ran and fell on his neck, and kiſſed him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The readineſs of the Father to receive his Son, is here noted; Firſt, by his looking on him afar off, <hi>For when he was yet a great way off, his Father ſaw him.</hi> Secondly, by run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to him, while he was afar off, <hi>He had compaſſion, and ran.</hi> Thirdly, by his kind imbracing of him, <hi>He fell on his neck, and kiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To begin with the firſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But when he was yet a great way, he ſaw him.]</hi> Albeit this be put here in the laſt place, yet it is referred by moſt of our Expoſitors to the firſt time of his Converſion; for it was this look that brought home this Prodigal. He ſaw him, and looked on him with the eyes of pity, and by looking upon him, infuſed into him the ſecret efficacy of his ſpirit, and pierced his heart with the beams of his grace, which ſo prevailed with him that it brought him to repentance, as it did with <hi>Peter,</hi> which made him to go out and weep bitterly for his ſins, after he had thrice denied his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. Thus they make it, as a cauſe of his Converſion. And taking it thus, this point will follow.</p>

                     <p>Many pregnant Examples might be brought, both of the unregenerate before their Converſion: as alſo of the Regenerate in their falls, after their Converſion, for the further confirming this point in hand.

                     <p>A ſecond Reaſon why Gods Grace is all in all in the work of our Converſion, may be this; That all matter of boaſting might be taken away, for we are very ready to aſcribe unto our ſelves, that which of Right belongs unto the Lord.

                     <p>The Reaſons are theſe. Firſt, becauſe man is the Workmanſhip of Gods own hands, and therefore he is the more ready and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to ſave him.</p>
                     <p>A third Reaſon may be this; becauſe none might deſpair of his mercy: he is ready to ſhew mercy, that by the example of ſuch as have found mercy, others alſo might reſort and repair unto him for mercy in the time of need.</p>

<pb n="156" facs="tcp:59886:109"/>hour; we are here but Tenants at will, and know not how ſoon our great Landlord will turn us out of this earthly Tabernacle: We may be cropt off like an ear of Corn: for what is this life but, as a neſt of ſtraw and clay, ſoon ſhaken a pieces. Many have ſeen a fair bright morning, who never behold the evening (as the <hi>Sodomites.</hi>) And upon ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the Sun hath ſet in the evening, to whom it never appeared riſing in the morning: So was it with the rich <hi>Glutton</hi> in the Goſpel. Seeing this is ſo, we have great cauſe ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily to repent.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, becauſe for the preſent, thy e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate is fearful, the wrath of God hangs o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thy head by a twined thred, if thou hadſt Eyes to ſee it: thou eateſt in danger of thy life, thou drinkeſt in danger, walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in danger, ſleepeſt in danger, lying be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween death and the Devil, as <hi>Peter</hi> did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two Soldiers, bound with two Chains.

                     <p>And firſt: This reproveth that wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful madneſs and exceeding great folly of ſuch as procraſtinate and defer their Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the Lord; and put off their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentnace, though the Lord call them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, and offer them never ſo fit an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity.</p>
                     <pb n="157" facs="tcp:59886:109"/>
                     <p>But, I have time enough to repent in, ſay ſome, what tell you me of Repentance, as yet? Is not God merciful? Did he not ſhew mercy to the Thief at the laſt gaſp? I doubt not but to be ſaved, as well as the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſeſt of you all. But thou who thus goeſt on head-long to Damnation, come hither and let me ſhew thee thy monſtrous folly: that if it be poſſible, thou mayſt be recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out of the ſnare of the Devil, who art thus taken by him at his will. Firſt, thou bleſſeſt thy ſelf with hope of long life, thou wilt repent when thou art old: but how knoweſt thou, that thou ſhalt live till thou comeſt to be old? Doſt not thou ſee, how upon the Stage of this World, ſome have longer parts, and ſome have ſhorter? And as we enter into the Lords Vineyard, do we not ſo go out? that is in ſuch a manner, and at ſuch an hour, ſome in the morning, ſome at noon, ſome at night; ſome die in the dawning of their lives; paſſing from one grave to another, being no ſooner come out of the womb of one Mother, but another Mother receives them into hers: Some die in Youth, as in the third hour, others die at thirty, forty, or fifty, as in the ſixth and ninth hour, and otherſome very old, as in the laſt hour of the day. Now tell me how many die before fifty, for one that live till they be
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:59886:110"/>paſt that age? What hope haſt thou to live till thou beeſt ſo old? Doeſt not thou daily ſee and hear of many that go well out at night, and are found dead in the morning; and of many other, that are ſuddenly ſlain, or come to ſome untimely death: why may it not be thus with thee? how vain then, and falſe is thy hope of long life? ſeeing none can tell what a day, what an hour may bring forth.</p>
                     <p>And Secondly, But ſay thou doſt live till thou beeſt old, and art freed from much of this trouble; having underſtanding, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, ſight, and ſenſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet who can tell whether God will hear thee at the laſt gaſp? For what can be more righteous, than that the Lord ſhould contemn thee at the hour of death, who haſt contemned him in thy whole life?</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, let this admoniſh every one of us to defer no time, but ſpeedily to repent. <hi>Abraham</hi> roſe up betimes to ſacrifice his Son; ſo do thou make haſt to ſacrifice thy ſin. <hi>Zacheus</hi> came down haſtily when he was called, why then do we defer coming to our Saviour? Hearken not to that Crow-crying <hi>cras, cras,</hi> to morrow, to morrow, the voice is diſmal.</p>
                     <p>But now we will proceed to the next words in the Parable.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>The readineſs of the Father to receive his Son, is here noted; Firſt, by his looking on him afar off, <hi>For when he was yet a great way off, his Father ſaw him.</hi> Secondly, by run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to him, while he was afar off, <hi>He had compaſſion, and ran.</hi> Thirdly, by his kind imbracing of him, <hi>He fell on his neck, and kiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him.</hi>

                        <hi>But when he was yet a great way, he ſaw him.</hi>] Albeit this be put here in the laſt place, yet it is referred by moſt of our Expoſitors to the firſt time of his Converſion; for it was this look that brought home this Prodigal. He ſaw him, and looked on him with the eyes of pity, and by looking upon him, infuſed into him the ſecret efficacy of his ſpirit, and pierced his heart with the beams of his grace, which ſo prevailed with him that it brought him to repentance, as it did with <hi>Peter,</hi> which made him to go out and weep bitterly for his ſins, after he had thrice denied his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. Thus they make it, as a cauſe of his Converſion. And taking it thus, this point will follow.</p>

                     <p>By theſe Circumſtances the heat and fire of his Affections is declared, and his entire Love unto his Son expreſſed, for a kiſs hath ever been as a pledge and pawn of kindneſs, which is poſſeſſed by it.

Thus the Father kiſſeth his Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Child, thereby to ſeal and confirm his love and good will towards him, that he might make no doubt thereof. So then, in that the Father doth thus manifeſt and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare his love and good will to his Son, after his coming into his Preſence; hence let us learn this Leſſon.</p>

Then this may ſerve to confute that Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> who hold that no man can be certainly aſſured of the love and favour of God, he may hope well, and ſo forth: But no man can have any aſſured Confidence. What is this, but a Rack and Torment to weak Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences? What doth this, but extinguiſh the truth and ſincerity, both of faith and love towards God? What Fruit bringeth this, but impatiency in time of trouble and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, and indeed maketh a way for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſparation of Gods Mercy.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, let this ſtir up every one of us to a diligent examination of our ſelves, whether God hath as yet kiſſed us <hi>with the kiſſes of his mouth,</hi> whether he hath as yet manifeſted his love unto us by ſigns and tokens. For, till we have aſſurance hereof, what comfort can we have?</p>
                     <p>And in the laſt place, this may ſerve for the great comfort of all ſuch as have Gods love manifeſted unto them by the former
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:59886:115"/>ſigns. For as the terrors are great which that Man hath in his Conſcience, who is in doubt of the love of the Almighty towards him; ſo is the comfort as great, which that Man hath, who is hereof perſwaded: For, come <hi>tribulation,</hi> or <hi>diſtreſs,</hi> or <hi>perſecution,</hi> or <hi>famine,</hi> or <hi>nakedneſs,</hi> or <hi>peril,</hi> or <hi>ſword,</hi> or <hi>life,</hi> or <hi>death,</hi> yet the certainty of Gods love will ſupport him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And the Son ſaid unto him, Father, I have ſinned againſt Heaven, and in thy ſight, and am no more worthy to be called thy Son.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now we come more particularly unto the words, which are a Confeſſion of ſins made by this Prodigal unto his Father. Wherein obſerve; Firſt, the <hi>Matter</hi> of his Confeſſion, <hi>I have ſinned.</hi> Secondly, the <hi>Circumſtances;</hi> as Firſt, <hi>to whom, viz.</hi> to his <hi>Father:</hi> Secondly, the <hi>manner</hi> how:</p>
                     <p>And that was with
<list>
                           <item>Exaggeration, <hi>Againſt Heaven, &amp;c.</hi>
                           </item>
                           <item>Humiliation, <hi>And am no more worthy, &amp;c.</hi>
                           </item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Reaſons of this point are theſe; Firſt, God cannot in Juſtice forgive, except we make our Confeſſion unto him. <hi>If we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:59886:115"/>our ſins, he is faithful and juſt to forgive us our ſins</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>John.</hi>) But if there be no Confeſſion, then there is no promiſe: How can God then without violating his Truth ſhew Mercy unto ſuch? And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaith <hi>Solomon, He that hideth his ſins ſhall not proſper; but whoſo confeſſeth and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaketh them ſhall have Mercy.</hi> Such a one then as doth thus confeſs, may look for Mercy, and none elſe.</p>
                     <p>A Second Reaſon is, Becauſe there is no ſound Repentance for ſin, where there is no true Confeſſion of ſin. For the inward ſight of ſin would open our mouths, and cauſe us to confeſs it. When the Heart is pricked, words will break forth, the Tongue cannot forbear: As we ſee in <hi>David,</hi> who ſo ſoon as his heart ſmote him for numbring of the People, cryed out, <hi>I have ſinned ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly in that which I have done.</hi> Thus, <hi>out of the abundance of the heart will the tongue ſpeak,</hi> as Chriſt ſaith.</p>
                     <p>Theſe may be the Reaſons.</p>
                     <p>The Uſes follow.</p>
                     <p>And Firſt (ſeeing this is ſo, <hi>That whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever would have Pardon of ſin muſt confeſs the ſame.</hi>) This ſerveth to Reprove ſuch as look for Pardon on Gods part, but will bring no Confeſſion for their part.</p>
                     <pb n="170" facs="tcp:59886:116"/>
                     <p>Is this ſo, that there is no Remiſſion, where there is no Confeſſion? Then let this Admoniſh every one that deſires to have their ſins remitted, to ſee, that they be truly and unfainedly confeſſed: Conceal them not, hide them not, excuſe them not, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them not, and above all, take heed of glorying in them. Seek not with <hi>Achan</hi> to hide that <hi>curſed thing,</hi> it will prove thy overthrow: Be not Secretary to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, it is no good Office; conceal not that which God commands thee to make known. Sins that are ſmoothered, will in the end feſter unto Death: Remember Remiſſion is promiſed, but upon condition of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion; ſuffer (then) no ſin to go uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, which thou wouldſt not have to go unpardoned.</p>
                     <p>And ſo I paſs from this to a third Uſe, which is for our direction: For, muſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion go before Remiſſion, then let every one look that as they confeſs, ſo they make an upright confeſſion. Many have confeſſed, yet found ſmall comfort; as <hi>Pharaoh, Saul,</hi> and <hi>Judas,</hi> with many more; if therefore we would ſpeed better than they did, we muſt look that our confeſſion be better than theirs was.</p>
                     <pb n="171" facs="tcp:59886:116"/>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Father.]</hi> Here we ſee to whom he makes confeſſion. It is not to the Servants, nor to his Brother, but to his <hi>Father.</hi> Hence learn;</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Confeſſion of ſin muſt be made unto the Lord. I acknowledged</hi> (ſaith <hi>David</hi>) <hi>my ſin unto the Lord.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </div>
                  <div type="part">
                     <head>The Reaſons are theſe.</head>
                     <p>Firſt, All ſin is committed againſt God. True it is, we may hurt and wrong men by our ſins, and bring much damage both to the Body and Goods of others by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting of them, as <hi>David</hi> to <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah;</hi> but the chiefeſt diſhonour is againſt God, whoſe Law is broken and tranſgreſſed.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, God only can forgive ſins, and none but he. <hi>It pertaineth only unto God to ſay, I have Pardoned, I will not deſtroy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And Laſtly, Confeſſion of ſin is a ſpecial part of Divine Worſhip. Now, <hi>God will not give his glory to another,</hi> he will not have any part ſtakes with him; <hi>Thou ſhalt Worſhip the Lord thy God, and him only ſhalt thou ſerve.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now for Uſes. And firſt, for that <hi>Auri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Confeſſion</hi> (held and maintained by that man of ſin) which upon pain of Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt be made in the Ear of a Prieſt
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:59886:117"/>by every one, immediately before the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of the Sacrament of the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. A cunning invention for the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering of all ſtates, and for the upholding and enriching of that Covetous and Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious See: Hereby they come to know the Hearts and Affections of Men; and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, they can quickly tell what courſe to take for themſelves, either for bringing good, or preventing miſchief, for the <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riching themſelves, and impoveriſhing of others.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Is this ſo, that confeſſion of ſin is to be made unto the Lord: Then ſee thou fly unto him when thou haſt offended, and make known thy faults to him, whom thou haſt much diſhonoured.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Againſt Heaven, and in thy ſight</hi>] He doth not mince and extenuate the matter; he ſaith not, Father, I have ſinned, but I had no bad meaning, I knew not what I did. Neither doth he plead the inſtability of his Youth, to extenuate his fault, but he ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravateth and enlargeth the grievouſneſs of his ſin, and ſets it out to the uttermoſt. 1. <hi>I have ſinned.</hi> 2. <hi>Againſt Heaven.</hi> 3. <hi>In thy ſight.</hi> All tend to the aggravation of his fault. To break a Lawful command en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned by the Magiſtrate (though of Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance) is a fault; wilfully to break, it is
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:59886:117"/>a greater; but to do it in his ſight and preſence, argueth great Rebellion. From the Prodigal his Practice, let us learn,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Doct. That it is the property of a true Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent, not to mince, or extenuate his ſin, but to aggravate and ſet it out in the worſt and vileſt manner that he can.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Reaſon may be this; Becauſe the Eyes of a Penitent are in ſome meaſure opened, ſo that he now ſeeth ſin in its own colours, and apprehendeth it as a deadly Enemy to Gods glory, and his own Souls Health. Now, we know how ready we are to ſpeak the worſt we can of thoſe who are Enemies unto us, and to ſet forth their vile Practiſes to the uttermoſt. Thus the hatred he beareth unto ſin, cauſeth him to think, that he can never ſufficiently diſplay it, and maketh him ſo diſpoſed, as that no mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious wicked man can ſo ſet forth the faults of his Enemy, whom he deadly hates, as he deſires to ſet forth the loathſomneſs of his own ſin. Thus we have ſeen the Reaſon.</p>
                     <pb n="174" facs="tcp:59886:118"/>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſes follow.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And is a Penitent thus qualified? Is there ſuch a diſpoſition in him, as that he will lay to his own charge, as much as poſſibly he can? Then what ſhall we ſay of ſuch as ſtudy this Art of mincing and extenuating ſin? The ſins of others they can enlarge, they have both will and skill in ſetting open to the view of the whole World, in every branch and circumſtance the faults of others, ſo that many times they appear to be greater than indeed they are. But in confeſſing of their own ſins, they have no ſuch gift nor faculty, than they have not done it; or if done it, yet it is not evil; or if it be evil, yet not very evil; or if very evil, yet not with an evil mind; or if ſo, yet by others perſwaſions; they do ſo mince the matter, that Mountains ſeem Mole-hills, and Mole-hills Motes.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Wouldſt thou have Pardon at the hands of God? Then enlarge thy ſins, and leſſen them not, ſtretch them out to the utmoſt pin, and ſet them forth at full, with their parts and circumſtances: At what time, in what place, after what manner, with what company they were committed; let no circumſtance of aggravation be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:59886:118"/>by which they may appear the more foul and filthy.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And am no more worthy to be called thy Son</hi>] See how he humbleth and abaſeth himſelf unto his Father, <hi>I am unworthy to be thy Son;</hi> yea, <hi>I am unworthy the very name of Son,</hi> ſo many have been my ſins, ſo lewd hath been my courſe. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction hence may be this;</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Doct. The only way to obtain Pardon for ſin, and procure Gods favour, is with an humble heart, and lowly Soul to come before him.</hi> The only way to be exalted by him is to come unto him in Humility of Soul, and lowlineſs of Spirit. The Practice of this Prodigal is a Preſident for us.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div type="part">
                     <head>The Reaſons may be theſe:</head>
                     <p>Firſt, Such only hath God promiſed to look upon, and ſhew Mercy to; <hi>To this man will I look, even to him that is Poor, and of a contrite ſpirit:</hi> And again, <hi>Thus ſaith the high and lofty one, that inhabiteth Eternity, whoſe Name is Holy, I dwell in the high and holy place: With him alſo that is of a contrite and humbled ſpirit, to revive the ſpirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones:</hi> As for the other, they have no promiſe of Favour or of Mercy.</p>
                     <pb n="176" facs="tcp:59886:119"/>
                     <p>And Secondly, ſuch only are capable of Grace and Mercy. Full Veſſels can receive no Liquor, and haughty Hearts no Favour, for they deſpiſe it. As therefore the Veſſel muſt be emptied, and the Air and Wind removed, before any ſolid Liquor can be received; ſo muſt thou firſt caſt out haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs and pride out of thy heart, before Mercy can be obtained.</p>
                     <p>Let the Uſe of this be for <hi>Exhortation.</hi> Come before the Lord with humbled Souls and contrite Spirits, for this is of him much ſet by. And to ſtir us up to the putting on of this grace (as the Apoſtle doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort us) conſider of theſe Motives: Firſt, Pride, it is the Devils firſt-born, and the Devils firſt Poyſon which Satan poured in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our Nature; and this (as <hi>Bernard</hi> ſpeaks) is the Devils Character: For as the Servants of Chriſt and Children of God, are known by <hi>Charity</hi> and <hi>Humility;</hi> ſo the Servants of Sin, and Sons of Satan, are known by <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Cruelty;</hi> and therefore let this move us to embrace the one, and abhor the other. Secondly, <hi>God exalts ſuch as are humble, but ſuch as are Proud doth his Soul hate.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>Humility</hi> is the keeper of all graces, but <hi>Pride</hi> is the ſpoyler of them. No Box better to keep thoſe Jewels in, than a Heart well lined with Humility.</p>
                     <pb n="177" facs="tcp:59886:119"/>
                     <p>Fourthly, <hi>Humility</hi> makes us like Chriſt himſelf, and therefore muſt needs be an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Vertue: This Grace he willeth us to learn of him, for he was meek and lowly in Heart. He diſdained not to waſh his Diſciples Feet, to teach them Humility. <hi>He made himſelf of no Reputation, and took up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him the form of a Servant,</hi> that we might learn of him to be humble. <hi>Let the ſame mind therefore be in you</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>that was in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> He was Humble, be thou then aſhamed to be Proud.</p>

                  <p>I would the point were to prove; Alas! it is too manifeſt, that there is an Unbro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly ſtrife between godly Brethren. <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, England,</hi> yea all <hi>England</hi> will give us in a teſt to this truth.

<pb n="182" facs="tcp:59886:122"/>malignant diſtemper? Here are two Brethren in the Text, as near as Nature, Society, and Religion could make them, whom neither native Country, nor tedious Travel, nor pinching Famine, nor threats of Danger or Diſtreſs could ſeparate; yet ſuch an unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Breach fell out between them, as that two ſuch ancient and dear Friends could not longer live together. Shall I ſhew you two others, who were Brethren by Country, by Calling, and by Grace, united together in one joynt Commiſſion of Apoſtleſhip; and yet a very ſmall matter occaſioned ſuch a ſharp Contention between them, as that thoſe which had been very faſt Companions in Love and Labour, were provoked to part aſunder. Between <hi>Abram</hi> and <hi>Lot</hi> the State peace was broken. Between <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas</hi> the Church peace was broken. But from the Text now read, we ſhall gather this Doctrine:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That where unbrotherly ſtrife is, all poſſible and ſpeedy means muſt be uſed for Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I need not light a Candle to this Sun, both Nature and Nation, Civility and Morality, Profeſſion and Religion, Truth and Chriſt beſpeak this Duty from us. There are no Counſels ſo obvious in Gods word, as thoſe which perſwade to Brotherly Amity, to
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:59886:122"/>Chriſtian Unity and peace, and a bleſſing is promiſed to Peaceableneſs and Peace-making both in Civil and in Eccleſiaſtical Differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
                  <p>The Arguments are likewiſe manifeſt and manifold, which our Saviour uſeth to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke unto Love. How Pathetical and full of Affection are thoſe Arguments of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, <hi>Philip.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 1, 2, 3. <hi>If there be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any Conſolation in Chriſt, if any Comfort of love, if any fellowſhip of the Spirit, if any Bowels and Mercies, fulfil ye my joy, that ye be like minded, having the ſame love, being of one mind. Let nothing be done through ſtrife and vain-glory.</hi> Methinks the Apoſtles ſoul and words flow out together, as he ſays elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.8. <hi>We are willing to impart not the Goſpel only, but our own Souls, becauſe you are dear unto us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What a heap of Unities doth the Apoſtle pile up in <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 4, 5, 6. <hi>One Body, one Spirit, one hope of our Calling, one Lord, one Faith, one Baptiſm, one God and Father of all, which is above all, and through all, and in you all.</hi> And now what is all this <hi>Oneneſs</hi> but to make us <hi>One,</hi> to impel Saints into the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the Spirit, and Bond of Peace?</hi> If all be <hi>one,</hi> why ſhould Brethren be <hi>two?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What mighty Convictions doth the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle hold forth from Natures light, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:59886:123"/>ſhewing how the united ſervices of all the members in the Body natural, do tutor the uniting of Chriſtians, and of all their Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, parts and gifts for the ſervice of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy myſtical. <hi>Variety</hi> of gifts are not beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on us to work <hi>Contrariety</hi> of Affection: It is a ſublime notation of unity which the Apoſtle there gives, <hi>v.</hi> 12. calling the Head and the Body one Chriſt, plainly intimating that ſuch who wilfully rend themſelves from the Body, do as much as in them lies to rend themſelves alſo from the Head.</p>
                  <p>But what need I ſtep beyond the Text for impulſives to inforce the duty of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine? Two I herefind, one above the Text, the other at the foot of it; <hi>Let there be no ſtrife between thee and me, neither between thy Herdſmen and my Herdſmen,</hi> ſaith <hi>Abram</hi> to <hi>Lot,</hi> and why? 1. <hi>Becauſe the Canaanite and the Perezite dwell in the Land.</hi> 2. <hi>Becauſe we are Brethren.</hi> Let us now examine theſe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Becauſe of the Canaanite and Perezite which dwell in the Land;</hi> as if <hi>Abram</hi> ſhould have ſaid, Why Brother <hi>Lot,</hi> do you not ſee that there is a Generation of ungodly men dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling amongſt us, who would willingly take the Advantage from our Diviſions to work us both out of this good Land? <hi>I pray thee</hi> therefore Brother, <hi>let there be no ſtrife</hi> betwen us.</p>
                  <pb n="185" facs="tcp:59886:123"/>
                  <p>Why but ſome will ſay, Whom do you mean by theſe <hi>Canaanites</hi> and <hi>Perizites?</hi> I'le ſhew you what Characters the Spirit of God doth hint unto us of them; the <hi>Canaa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite</hi> is derived from that curſed Seed, who did mock at his Fathers Nakedneſs, you have the ſtory in <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.25. The <hi>Perezite</hi> from an Hebrew root which ſignifies to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide. Both of theſe miſchievous enough to the power of Godlineſs, and to the peace of the Goſpel. The <hi>wild Boar</hi> and the <hi>little Foxes</hi> do exceeding great (though not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual) hurt unto the Spiritual <hi>Vine:</hi> The <hi>little Foxes</hi> ſpoil her Grapes, but the <hi>wild Boar</hi> would root it up. The Wolfes teeth and the Fanthers breath do both kill, but the Panther with delight, the Wolfe with cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty.</p>
                  <p>But what do you tell us of the <hi>Canaa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites</hi> and the <hi>Perizites,</hi> are there any ſuch dwelling in our Land?</p>
                  <p>My Brethren, I accuſe none here, but I am very certain you will all bear me witneſs that there is a Generation of <hi>Canaanites</hi> in the Land, which ſcoff at Saints, at Miniſters, at Profeſſion, at Ordinances, and would ſcoff at Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, if he were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, who do not only triumph in ſuch na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſes as they ſee, but with thoſe in <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oah, They pull off the beautiful Garment from
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:59886:124"/>them that paſs by them peaceably;</hi> they ſtudy all the miſchiefs they can, to render Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the ſincere Profeſſors thereof, odious.</p>
                  <p>Beloved, formerly love was the Badge, and true Cogniſance of a true Chriſtian: But I much wonder where we may now find a <hi>David,</hi> and a <hi>Jonathan;</hi> an <hi>Euſebius,</hi> and a <hi>Pamphilius;</hi> yea, a <hi>Ruth,</hi> and a <hi>Naomy?</hi> Where ſhall we now ſeek <hi>unam animam in duobus corporibus incluſam,</hi> one Soul in two Bodies? Where ſhall we look for ſuch as were the Apoſtles, that had but one heart, and one Soul? Alas, No! thoſe golden days are paſt and gone, and now the Dog-days are come in, every one biting and barking at his Neighbour: Not like Chriſtians, not like Brethren, nor yet like Saints; but even like Bears and Tigers ſtriving to tear one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; yea, like <hi>Scithians</hi> and <hi>Canibals,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to eat up another, as void of all natural Love and Affection. Oh my Friends! is this Chriſtianity? is this to be members of the ſame Body? is this to be Sons of the ſame Father? <hi>Have we not all one Father? hath not one God created us? Why then do we deal ſo treacherouſly one with another, every man againſt his Brother,</hi> Mal. 2.10. But hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I ſhall hope better things of you; and let not (I beſeech you) my hopes be fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated, and of none effect, but follow you
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:59886:124"/>
                     <hi>Peace with all men, eſpecially with thoſe that are of the houſhold of Faith, be ye all of one mind,</hi> 1 Pet. 3.9. <hi>having compaſſion one of another, love as Brethren, be pitiful, be courteous: Not rendring evil for evil, railing for railing: but contrariwiſe, bleſſing; knowing that you are thereunto called, that you ſhould inherit a bleſſing</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But to proceed, there is another Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Perizites</hi> in the Land, who like <hi>Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons Foxes, have Fire-brands at their tails,</hi> who make it their deſign to divide, that they might rule. I mean not ſuch, who through tenderneſs of Conſcience, do ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, but the Politick <hi>Perizzite,</hi> who is ſet on work by <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Hell</hi> to retard the Chriſtian Reformation through the diviſions of Brethren. For is not the hand of <hi>Joab</hi> in all this? Hath not the Devil and the Jeſuit made it their Maſter-piece by moſt unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Diviſions to break the ſtrength of that Party that have reſolvedly eſpouſed the true <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion; yea, and I am perſwad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that there are many truly Godly, who are trappaned by them, that are altogether <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="188" facs="tcp:59886:125"/>the Controverſie of the Kingdom of <hi>Theſſaly,</hi> between thoſe two diſcording Brethren who contending for it, which he fairly took from both.</p>
                  <p>Oh that we could undermine the Gates of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Hell</hi> this day, by our moſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py uniting! Methinks there is no Argument can have more force in it than this, when we know that there are ſuch Generations of men amongſt us, who do wait for this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, to break in upon us through the Lane of our Diviſions, and to raiſe their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed fortunes on our miſerable Ruines.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tully</hi> in his <hi>Offices</hi> preſents us with a very pat ſtory to cautionate the Unbrotherly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord of theſe times. The <hi>Nolans</hi> and the <hi>Neopolitans</hi> having a Controverſie about a parcel of Ground which lay between their ſeveral Countrys, <hi>Fabius Labeo</hi> being invit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to determine the difference, gave unto them the exterior limits of the Ground ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning to their reſpective Countries, and took unto the State of <hi>Rome</hi> all the Land which lay in the midſt between the Confines. <hi>My Brethren,</hi> let us be well adviſed, leſt whilſt we do moſt unhappily contend about indifferent things, our good Friends of <hi>Rome</hi> do not come in, and give us as much ſenſual Liberty as we deſire, but take away from us thoſe ſaving Goſpel-Truths, and that
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:59886:125"/>Purity and Power of Ordinances which lie between us <hi>in medio,</hi> on both ſides contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Argument that lies at the foot of the Text, is the force of Brotherhood: <hi>For we are Brethren,</hi> and we are Brethren many ways: 1. We are <hi>Brethren</hi> by Country.</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>Neſcio qua natale ſolum dulcedine cunctos</l>
                     <l>Ducit —</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>Should the Lord ſend us into a ſtrange Land to <hi>hang up our muſical Inſtruments by the Waters of our Captivity,</hi> and to weep over thoſe <hi>Songs of Sion</hi> which here we might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy with peace and ſpiritual delight, and do not, then this Country Brotherhood would have Argument enough to cement us. Ah my Brethren! do we need ſuch a rod to whip us into the ſenſe of Brotherly love? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Provocations of Sons and Daughters are greateſt Provocations, and our Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father hath Provocations enough to turn us all out of doors, when we cannot live peaceably together in his houſe.</p>
                  <p>But ſecondly, <hi>Brethren by Blood,</hi> as ſome of us are, and Brethren by Grace, as <hi>Abram</hi> and <hi>Lot</hi> were, Children of the ſame <hi>heavenly Father,</hi> partakers of the ſame <hi>Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> begotten of the ſame <hi>immortal Seed,</hi>
                     <pb n="190" facs="tcp:59886:126"/>bred up in the ſame <hi>houſhold of Faith,</hi> made to drink into one and <hi>the ſame Spirit,</hi> parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the ſame <hi>heavenly Calling,</hi> Heirs to the ſame <hi>immortal Inheritance,</hi> and bound up together in the ſame <hi>bundle of life,</hi> and Bond of the <hi>Covenant of Grace.</hi> O methinks fleſh and Bones ſhould ſooner ſeparate in the Body natural, than ſuch Spiritual Nerves and Sinews be broken in the Body myſtical.</p>
                  <p>Beloved, we ſhould all <hi>love as Brethren,</hi> as genuinely and naturally as Brethren, that's our Rule; but if we cannot hold propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the Rule, to love as Brethren, yet let us keep correſpondency with the Object, to <hi>love the Brotherhood.</hi> There is nothing ſets the common Adverſary higher in the Scorners Chair, than the Diſcords of Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren. The Devil hath Propheſied, that the Rents in Chriſts Kingdom ſhould make room for his. Shall I give you his plain Language in ſome that wiſh well to his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom? The Presbyterians and <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> men will fall out, and then all will be ours again. Now, my Brethren, let not our Diviſions make the Devil a true Prophet. Let us honour God, and Religion, and our ſelves, and ſhame the Devil; let our bleſſed Union diſcover him, as he is, a Lyar from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning.</p>

                  <p>Now, I would encourage your endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, by directing it. Some Directions you have from the Copy we have in hand; others we ſhall add for your Benefit and Practice.</p>

                  <p>The firſt is this: The higher any man is in place or parts above his Brethren, the more is his Duty to be firſt in ſeeking Peace. <hi>Erat Abraham &amp; major natu &amp; uſu rerum prudentior. Abraham</hi> was the Elder and Nobler of the two here, both in place and parts, and yet he is the firſt that ſues for Reconciliation: We hear not in his mouth the Language of theſe times; Sir, I am your Elder, and your better, I look that you ſhould ſtoop to me; I wonder, Sir, that you will ſuffer your Servants to fall out with mine; why, have not I bred you up from a Boy? Have you not gotten all that you have under me? And what Common or Paſture can your Shepherds challenge, but what they have at my Courteſie?

                  <p>We are all bound <hi>to ſerve one another in love,</hi> and it is not incongruous unto Gods way, that <hi>the elder ſhould ſerve the younger.</hi> He that is moſt eminent in grace or place, to be moſt forward in ſeeking Peace; this is moſt God-like, the moſt Excellent Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:59886:127"/>that is offended, deſcends from his Throne of Glory to <hi>beſeech</hi> proud <hi>Sinners to be Reconciled unto him.</hi> O, my Brethren, you that are <hi>more Excellent than your Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,</hi> that have parts, or gifts, or places above your Brethren, ſee how Religion di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects you to improve them in the deſires and endeavours for Peace. But if this be ſo, what ſhall we then think of the wrangling and brawling Spirits of theſe days, that are of ſuch a ſalt, fiery Humour, that they can ſcarce live peaceably with any, juſt like Flax or Gun-powder, the leaſt ſpark imaginable will catch them; that will ſtrive and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend about Trifles, like the Frog and the Mouſe for the <hi>Mariſh ground,</hi> till the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry Kite come and ſnatch them both away. Ah! ſurely theſe muſt needs be the laſt days, ſince Love and Charity is grown ſo cold; for you ſhall ſcarce find a Pariſh that is not divided; you ſhall hardly come into a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily that is not diſ-joynted, every one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ready to bite and devour one another. Beloved, if that you would but ſeriouſly conſider what wide Ears and long Tongues too many Men now adays have, it would make you bluſh, ſweat, and ſtand amazed. Where are the Friends whom we dare put Truſt in now adays? We are all in pieces, and all divided, like <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Troop, into
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:59886:128"/>divers Companies; or like <hi>Laban</hi>'s Sheep of divers colours, ſome white, ſome black, and ſome ſpeckled; ſome of this mind, and ſome of that; ſome of one Opinion, and ſome of another: We are a <hi>Chaos</hi> of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, a <hi>Tohn, and a Bohn,</hi> like the People ſcattered over the Land of <hi>Egypt</hi> to gather ſtubble, and to pick up ſtraws. In a word, there is few amongſt us live like Brethren.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Rule is this: Chriſtians muſt be content to yield in their own Right for a Godly Peace, whoſe Right was ever clearer or ſurer to the whole Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> than <hi>Abraham</hi>'s was? He had it all made over to him and to his Poſterity from the Lord Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramount <hi>of the whole Earth;</hi> and yet when this ſtrife fell out between <hi>Abrahams</hi> and <hi>Lot</hi>'s Shepherds about <hi>common of Paſture,</hi> he propounded unto <hi>Lot</hi> his choice of any part of the whole Land that was before him, and would content himſelf with <hi>Lot</hi>'s leavings. <hi>See,</hi> ſaith <hi>Abraham, is not the whole Land before thee, ſeparate thy ſelf, I pray thee, from me,</hi> (not that <hi>Abraham</hi> was willing to part with <hi>Lot,</hi> but that they might preſerve that Brotherly Union at a diſtance, which they could not keep by keeping together,) <hi>If thou wilt take the left hand</hi> (ſaith <hi>Abraham</hi> to <hi>Lot,</hi>) <hi>then will I
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:59886:128"/>go to the right; or if thou depart to the right hand, then will I go to the left.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, <hi>Lot</hi>'s Eye was ſo great upon the <hi>fat and pleaſant Valleys of Sodom,</hi> as that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting his good manners to his Uncle, he made his choice, and <hi>Abraham</hi> loſt nothing by his condeſcention unto him; for as ſoon as <hi>Lot</hi> was ſeparated from him, the Lord appears unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> and renews his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of the <hi>whole Land to him and to his Seed.</hi> See, my Brethren, God will not ſuffer us to be loſers in any thing, wherein for his ſake we deny our ſelves and our own right, in order to a Religious peace.</p>
                  <p>If our Brother <hi>Lot</hi> hath a mind to the fat and pleaſant portion of <hi>Sodom,</hi> let him take it; ſurely if his deſign be profit and not peace, the Lord will find a time to <hi>fire</hi> him out of it again; it matters not what we ſuffer in our own particular Intereſts, ſo as God might have his glory in a godly peace. Were there more of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s condeſcention amongſt us, how eaſily might our unhappy differences be taken up.</p>
                  <p>The third Rule is; That in order to peace all expoſtulations and exprobrations of injuries be laid aſide. We hear nothing from <hi>Abraham</hi> of any unkindneſs, but only a loving and humble entreaty; <hi>Let there be no ſtrife, I pray thee, between thee and me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="196" facs="tcp:59886:129"/>
                  <p>The repeating of an old wrong, is but as the rubbing upon an old ſore, which doth but anger it, and make the Cure the worſe.</p>
                  <p>It is an Holy Art of forgetfulneſs to be forgetful of Injuries. I would there were Graves made, <hi>Domicilia ſilentii,</hi> Houſes of ſilence between us and all our Diſſenting Brethren, that upon ſober and Religious grounds do ſeparate from us, to bury all paſſions and ſuſpicions of Injuries; and let theſe Graves be <hi>Kibroth Hattaavah,</hi> Graves of Luſt I mean, to bury all thoſe Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which have provoked one the other.</p>
                  <p>My Brethren, you do all profeſs your ſelves to be <hi>Abraham</hi>'s <hi>Children,</hi> inheritors of thoſe promiſes which were made to him; remember that Chriſts Argument doth as much concern the <hi>Children by promiſe,</hi> as the <hi>Children by fleſh; if you are</hi> Abraham's <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, you will then do the works of</hi> Abraham: Amongſt others forget not theſe which I have ſhewed you.</p>
                  <p>And ſhall I now, Brethren, take up a Reproof, or rather a Lamentation over thoſe imbittered cenſures which Godly Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren let fall one againſt the other? Are we Brethren? Are we Godly? I am confident that it may be ſafely concluded, that ſome on both ſides are Brethren truly Godly. Why then, why are we ſo bitter one againſt
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:59886:129"/>the other? What means the Gall and Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood that is in our Diſcourſes and Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings? Ah, my Brethren, my Brethren! did our Lord Chriſt waſh his Apoſtles Feet, and amongſt them a <hi>Judas</hi> feet, and ſhall we throw dirt in one anothers Faces? Is this Chriſt-like? Doth this become Chriſtians? Did he pour out his precious <hi>Blood</hi> to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe our <hi>Peace,</hi> and ſhall we draw out one anothers Blood in breaking our Peace? Did he bequeath <hi>his Peace</hi> unto his people, as his laſt and beſt Legacy he had to leave unto them, and ſhall we like fooliſh Children ſpend our portion in undoing one the other?</p>
                  <p>There are two other Rules now, which though they be not in the Text, yet they do belong unto the Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is this; There are three Beautiful Siſters, which are inſeparable Companions unto this happy Heavenly Off-ſpring, I mean a Religious and well-grounded peace.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is <hi>Truth, Love the Truth and Peace,</hi> Zach. 8.19. Love <hi>Peace,</hi> but <hi>Truth</hi> with it, <hi>Truth</hi> before it. If you let go <hi>Truth, Peace</hi> will not be worthy your Love, you love <hi>Peace,</hi> becauſe it is the Mother of plenty, but if you provide not for <hi>Truth</hi> to dwell with it, your <hi>Peace</hi> will prove the Daughter of Vanity, your <hi>Peace</hi> can be neither true
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:59886:130"/>nor lovely, that is ſeparated from the love of the <hi>Truth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecond is <hi>Righteouſneſs. Mercy and Truth are met together, Righteouſneſs and Peace have kiſſed each other, Pſal.</hi> 85.10. In that notable meeting of the Divine Attributes in Jeſus Chriſt, theſe two, <hi>Righteouſneſs and Peace</hi> are matcht together, no <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> can procure our <hi>Peace</hi> with God, but the <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt, and no <hi>Peace</hi> can ſtand with Men, unleſs the influences of that <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> be upon them. If <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs</hi> be found in our Courts of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicature, in our Streets, and in our Houſes, and the Land be not purged of Blood, and Juſtice be not done upon the <hi>Achans,</hi> the Troublers of our <hi>Peace,</hi> our <hi>Peace</hi> will be forced to depart again as ſoon as it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured.</p>
                  <p>The third is <hi>Holineſs: Follow peace with all men, and Holineſs, without which no man ſhall ſee the Lord,</hi> Heb. 12.14. <hi>Follow peace and holineſs</hi> joyntly, but not equally. <hi>Peace</hi> for <hi>Holineſs</hi> ſake, and <hi>holineſs</hi> above <hi>peace;</hi> for this is implyed in the force of the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: <hi>For without Holineſs no man ſhall ſee the Lord.</hi> We may <hi>ſee the Lord</hi> without having <hi>peace</hi> with all men, but not without the having of <hi>Holineſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="199" facs="tcp:59886:130"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Let there be no ſtrife between thee and me,</hi> ſaith <hi>peace</hi> to <hi>truth, peace</hi> to <hi>righteouſneſs, peace</hi> to <hi>holineſs:</hi> But let there be nothing but ſtrife between me and thee, ſaith <hi>peace</hi> to <hi>error, peace</hi> to <hi>injuſtice, peace</hi> to <hi>profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> And if any Miniſter ſhould be ſo bold to <hi>ſeparate thoſe whom God hath joyned,</hi> or to <hi>joyn</hi> thoſe whom God hath <hi>ſeparated,</hi> he ſhould indeed Preach Sedition, but not againſt Man, but againſt a Holy and Jealous God. That true-righteous-holy-Peace, that bleſſed Daughter of Heaven, will certainly forbid all Contracts that ſhall be publiſhed between <hi>error, injuſtice, profaneneſs,</hi> and her ſelf, <hi>there is no peace to the wicked, ſaith my God,</hi> nor no peace with the wicked. Or if it were poſſible that Peace ſhould own ſuch Contracts, Chriſt himſelf, who is the <hi>Prince of Peace,</hi> would never own her for his Daughter; for in this caſe he ſaith, <hi>I come not to ſend Peace on the Earth, but the Sword.</hi> In a word, let go either of theſe ſiſter-graces, and your Peace, be what it will, it will undo you. This is now the firſt Rule in order to a Godly Peace.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond I have to lay before you, is this, That if we will needs be ſtriving, let <hi>Maſſah</hi> and <hi>Meribah,</hi> thoſe <hi>Waters of ſtrife,</hi> run in their right Channels. And now, to break the ſtrength of our unhappy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:59886:131"/>I would fix them upon their true and proper Objects. There are two which I ſhall propound unto you, 1. That which you ſhould contend for. 2. That which you ſhould contend againſt.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That which you ſhould contend for, is that to which <hi>Jude</hi> exhorts you, <hi>Jude</hi> 2. that you ſhould <hi>earneſtly contend for the Faith which was once delivered unto the Saints.</hi> There is <hi>Faith</hi> a Grace, and <hi>Faith</hi> the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of that Grace. <hi>Faith</hi> a Grace is that whereby we cloſe with all Divine Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, not only by a conſent unto the truth of them in our underſtandings, but by a taſte of the ſweetneſs of them in our wills and affections; and thoſe Divine Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are alſo called <hi>the Faith of Saints:</hi> Becauſe they are thoſe things which <hi>Saints</hi> by <hi>Faith</hi> do live upon: Now, <hi>Saints</hi> muſt contend for both; but that which <hi>Jude</hi> doth here intend, is <hi>the Doctrine of Faith;</hi> and for this we muſt <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>contend,</hi> above all that ſtrength we contend with. The word is a compound, borrowed from thoſe that did ſtrive for Maſteries in the <hi>Olympick</hi> Games, whoſe ſtrife was vigorous as for Life, yet here we muſt ſtrive above that, and we have a ſupernatural ſtrength given unto us to ſtrive with; we muſt put forth all that which Nature or Grace can miniſter
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:59886:131"/>unto us. Our Lives muſt not be dear unto us, or any thing that is dearer than our Lives, to preſerve thoſe ſaving truths which are the purchaſe of ſo many Martyrs Blood, yea, of the precious Blood of the Son of God, our New Teſtament is the <hi>New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Blood.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are three energetical Arguments in this perſwaſive of <hi>Jude,</hi> inciting the Duty he perſwades unto.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The tranſcendent excellency of that which we contend for.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The mighty oppoſition which is againſt it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The irreparable loſs of it, being once gone.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The tranſcendent excellency of that which we contend for. It is the Imperial <hi>gift,</hi> the <hi>treaſury,</hi> the <hi>inheritance of Saints. Naboth</hi> would rather part with his Life than with his Inheritance, but an Inheritance of a Life Immortal, how much is it to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before a Mortal Life, or Inheritance? It is ſtoried of <hi>Troy,</hi> that in the <hi>Grecian</hi> Siege it had an Oracle, that if it could keep its <hi>Palladium,</hi> the Image of their Goddeſs of Wiſdom, their City ſhould not be loſt. Beloved, this is our <hi>Palladium,</hi> loſe it, and loſe all. <hi>The Glory of God</hi> in <hi>Ezekiels</hi> Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, did ſoon <hi>depart</hi> from the <hi>City,</hi> when
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:59886:132"/>it was once <hi>departed</hi> from the <hi>Sanctuary.</hi> If the Lord take <hi>coals from the Altar,</hi> to ſcatter over a Kingdom, the Judgment of it ſhall ſpeed after with a Vengeance. When <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meneus</hi> and <hi>Alexander did make ſhipwrack of Faith,</hi> they made ſhipwrack of a <hi>good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience</hi> with it. It was the great comfort of <hi>Pauls</hi> Conſcience upon his death-bed, that <hi>he had kept the Faith;</hi> and his keeping the Faith was the main prop of his Confidence, that <hi>from thenceforth there was laid up for him a Crown of Righteouſneſs.</hi> If you let go Faith, you loſe your <hi>Comfort,</hi> your <hi>Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> your <hi>Crown.</hi> If therefore you will contend, <hi>contend as earneſtly</hi> as you will for this. <hi>Contend for the Faith once given to the Saints.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecond Argument to provoke unto this <hi>holy Contention,</hi> is the <hi>mighty oppoſition</hi> which <hi>Saints</hi> find againſt the <hi>Faith,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore would the Apoſtle have us <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>contend earneſtly;</hi> ſo we tranſlate it, but that is too low; you muſt more than contend, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks in another ſenſe, not only <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your power, but beyond your power:</hi> The Doctrine of Faith, as it never wanted <hi>ſome Witneſſes</hi> to <hi>defend</hi> it, ſo it ever had <hi>many Adverſaries</hi> to <hi>oppoſe</hi> it: <hi>The Gates of Hell,</hi> though they cannot <hi>prevail againſt it,</hi> yet they will do againſt it all the ſpite they
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:59886:132"/>can. Hereſie is like that Triple-headed Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, if one head be cut off, three will ariſe in the place of it. And Hereticks like thoſe <hi>Romans</hi> in their Wars with <hi>Carthage,</hi> they will never be quiet, either Conquerors, or Conquered. Surely, if ever the <hi>Gates of Hell</hi> were ſet open in <hi>England,</hi> they are now ſet wide open, and the <hi>Locuſts of the bottomleſs pit,</hi> even cover the face of the Land. It yields yet ſome comfortable hopes unto us, that the Lord hath a moſt beautiful work of Reformation upon the wheel in <hi>England,</hi> for that the Devil and the Jeſuit are ſo put to it to beſtir themſelves. Never did Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie and Blaſphemy with that whoriſh impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence oppoſe the fundamental Truths of Goſpel Grace, as now they do, but bleſſed be God, who hath awakened the zeal of ſo many <hi>faithful Servants of the Lord Jeſus</hi> in all parts of the Kingdom to give <hi>Teſtimony to his truth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>My Brethren, let us reſolve not to ſpend our <hi>breath</hi> only, but our <hi>blood</hi> in a good Confeſſion, if God ſhould call for it. <hi>Joſephus</hi> hath a ſtory worthy our obſervance: That when <hi>Pontius Pilate</hi> would have inforced the Statue of <hi>Nero</hi> into the Temple of the <hi>Jews,</hi> the zeal of the people inkindled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, it being againſt the Law of their holy Religion; <hi>Pilate</hi> purpoſing to inforce
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:59886:133"/>that by the Sword, which his Rhetorick could not perſwade, drew them into a place where he had laid an Ambuſcado of Armed men, who, upon his ſignal, were to do exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution upon thoſe who withſtood his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. The <hi>Jews</hi> being conſtant to their Principle of Religion, eſpying their danger approaching, did all, as one man, open their naked breaſts to the pointed Swords of their Executioners, reſolving rather upon and hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable death with the ſafety of their Religion, than an ignominious life with the loſs of it.</p>
                  <p>The third Argument for this <hi>holy Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> is the irrecoverable loſs of our Faith being once gone. It was <hi>once given unto the Saints,</hi> and but once: It was once given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Rome,</hi> and once unto <hi>Macedonia,</hi> and once unto the ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſia minor;</hi> and when once they had loſt it, it was never as yet given to them again. <hi>Sol occidere &amp; redire poteſt:</hi> If the Sun in the firmament doth ſet, it will riſe again; but if this Sun of Righteouſneſs once ſet upon a Land, an irrecoverable midnight of ſpiritual darkneſs ſucceeds upon it. If we loſe our Eſtates, we may recover them again; if we loſe our Friends, God may raiſe us up ſome other; if we loſe our Lives, we may exchange them for a better; but if we loſe the <hi>Faith once given to the Saints,</hi> being once loſt, it is loſt
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:59886:133"/>for ever; and we loſe with it our <hi>Souls,</hi> our <hi>Heaven,</hi> our <hi>Chriſt,</hi> our <hi>God,</hi> and theſe <hi>irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocably.</hi> Ah dear Chriſtians, if ever ye will <hi>contend</hi> for any thing, <hi>contend for the Faith once given unto the Saints.</hi> And that is how the firſt object of your <hi>holy Contention,</hi> that which you ſhould contend for.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond is that which you ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend againſt: and here I ſhall propound two objects; firſt, of perſons; ſecondly, of things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, for Perſons, the Royal Prophet writes us a Copy, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.21, 22. <hi>Do not I hate them, O Lord, that hate thee? and do I not earneſtly contend with thoſe, that riſe up againſt thee? yea, I hate them with perfect ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, I count them mine</hi> utter <hi>enemies.</hi> Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly there is a Generation of men in this Age, whoſe hearts riſe up againſt God, and againſt the power of Godlineſs. Gods <hi>right hand</hi> hath already <hi>found out many,</hi> and will certainly <hi>find out more of thoſe that hate him.</hi> Take heed good Friends, how you confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate with thoſe againſt whom the Lord is ingaged. Will you be tutor'd alittle from that ſtory of <hi>Judah</hi> in <hi>Ahaz</hi>'s time, in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth and eighth Chapters of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> when prophane <hi>Syria,</hi> and Apoſtate <hi>Iſrael</hi> combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned together againſt honeſt <hi>Judah,</hi> their <hi>hearts</hi> did <hi>ſhake</hi> as <hi>Aſpy</hi> leaves: The Lord
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:59886:134"/>ſends a Prophet to aſſure them, that theſe <hi>two ſmoaking fire-brands,</hi> which had more ſmoke than fire in them, ſhould not hurt them; <hi>Judah,</hi> though with much ado, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, proſpered; and he combined Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies are ſcattered. Diſcontented <hi>Iſrael</hi> not humbled under Gods hand ſo viſibly againſt them, reſolve yet to recruit greater Forces againſt <hi>Judah: The Bricks are fallen, but we will build with hewen ſtones; the Siccamores are cut down, but we will change them into Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dars. Judah</hi> forgetting Gods former Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe and deliverance, ſends to the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> for aid: The Lord ſends his Prophet to them again, and tells them, That <hi>becauſe they had refuſed the ſoft running waters of Siloa, the mighty waters of Aſsyria ſhould overflow them.</hi> Now what were thoſe waters of <hi>Siloa? Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loa</hi> was a River that brake out at the foot of Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> and ran through the Streets of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to which the Church alludes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 46.4. <hi>There is a River, the ſtreams thereof ſhall make glad the City of God.</hi> This River here is Jeſus Chriſt, the <hi>Fountain of Gods pleaſures,</hi> the ſtreams are his promiſes in which he makes out himſelf for the comfort of his people in ſaddeſt confuſions. Now <hi>Judah</hi> had a ſpecial intimation of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace to aſſertain their former de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance, as all temporary promiſes muſt
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:59886:134"/>have, their ſtrength and bleſſing out of that. But forgetting both their mercy and their duty, and ſeeking ſtrength from an <hi>arm of fleſh,</hi> which God had deſpiſed, <hi>they were not ſtrengthened, but diſtreſſed by it,</hi> ſaith the ſtory 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.20. Lo this is all the kindneſs we are like to receive from ſuch Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates; the Lord therefore counſels the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right-hearted in <hi>Judah; Say ye not a Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracy to all them to whom this people ſhall ſay a Confederacy, neither fear ye their fear, nor be afraid, but ſanctifie the Lord of Hoſts himſelf, and let him be your Fear, and let him be your Dread, and he ſhall be for a ſanctuary unto you.</hi> But what got Apoſtate <hi>Iſrael</hi> by her prophane Confederates? Why, <hi>Iſay</hi> 9.11, 12. we ſhall find that they taſted the ſame bitter ſauce with unbelieving <hi>Judah,</hi> they were <hi>with open mouth devoured</hi> by their good Friends the <hi>Syrians,</hi> with whom they had before <hi>combined</hi> againſt <hi>Judah; Foelix quem faciunt aliena pericula cautum.</hi> I wiſh that <hi>Judah</hi>'s and <hi>Iſraels</hi> ſufferings may cautionate the godly in <hi>London</hi> how they confederate with thoſe that are ungodly. Surely <hi>they ſhall not ſtrengthen, but diſtreſs themſelves</hi> by combining with thoſe that are manifeſt ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to God and Goodneſs.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Judges the ſecond and the firſt,</hi> we read of an <hi>Angel of the Lord that came up from Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:59886:135"/>to Bochim,</hi> to mind the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God of their <hi>Forgetfulneſs of Gods great mercy</hi> in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering them out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and of <hi>their breach of Covenant</hi> in making a League with thoſe <hi>Canaanites,</hi> whom the Lord had curſed. And he wrought ſo effectually upon their hearts, as that they <hi>wept abundantly.</hi> Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly <hi>London</hi> ſhall know, <hi>that they have had a Prophet amongſt them:</hi> And they ſhall one day weep for their Confederacy with wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men; if the Grace of God doth not now provoke their Tears, the <hi>wrath</hi> of God will <hi>hereafter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecond Object which we are to ſtrive againſt, are our own Luſts, <hi>ſtriving againſt ſin,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.4. I am ſure this is without all queſtion, that <hi>ſin</hi> is our enemy, breaking our Peace both with God and man, and <hi>killing</hi> as well with <hi>kiſſes,</hi> as with <hi>blows.</hi> God hath no enemy but this, or ſuch whom this doth make to be his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. Now ſpend all your Arrows, as long, as ſtrong as you can upon this Enemy: here ſtrive and ſpare not. If you ſpare any one, that one may undo your Souls as ſoon as a thouſand. There is more evil in one ſin, than there is worth in all the good you do, or can do; yea, more than the vertue of the whole Creation is able to expiate. One <hi>Achan</hi> is enough to diſturb the peace of all
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:59886:135"/>
                     <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and never let <hi>England</hi> think to have a firm peace, if <hi>Englands</hi> ſins remain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reformed. Now ſtrive as much againſt your <hi>Achans</hi> as your <hi>Abſoloms,</hi> your <hi>Dalilahs</hi> as your <hi>Thamars,</hi> your <hi>Rimmons</hi> as your <hi>Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi> your <hi>Davids</hi> as your <hi>Goliahs,</hi> I mean your covert, as your open ſins, your loved as your loathed luſts, your Heart-abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as your Life-ſcandals, your Babe-ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities as your Giant-provocations. And, Oh my dear Friends! How much was the Lord of Sabbaths and his Ordinances honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, when our Tribes with their Servants did march in good array unto the Temple of the Lord? A great complaint there is every where of bad Servants; but let Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours of Families lay their hands on their own Hearts, and ſee if the fault be not moſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly their own, who take no more care to make their Servants good. I know well, that all Governours have not ability alike to provoke their Servants unto Good, but all have Authority alike to keep them from evil: And if they be not as Eagles to carry them on their Wings to Heaven, yet they ſhould be as Sparrows to lead them unto Gods Houſe. <hi>Solomon</hi> did ſo order his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, as that the Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> did think them happy that lived under his Roof. You have the choiceſt Youth of all the Families
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:59886:136"/>in <hi>England</hi> truſted with you in your City; if they ſhould miſcarry through your neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, how publick, how great will that miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief be? <hi>In a word,</hi> may I ſay to you as that Prophet to the King of <hi>Iſrael, If thou let any eſcape</hi> (if thou connive at any ſin or ſinner) <hi>thy life ſhall go for his life;</hi> but if as the <hi>Syrian ſword</hi> did the King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> you would ſingle out ſome luſts, let me bring forth to juſtice, eſpecially theſe:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Strive againſt <hi>that evil heart of unbelief,</hi> which is in ſome degree in the beſt of us. There is no ſin damns but unbelief is in the company of it. When the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were upon the borders of the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> their <hi>unbelief</hi> did ſend them back to <hi>wander forty years in the wilderneſs, till all their carkaſſes were waſted in it.</hi> We lately thought our ſelves even <hi>entring into our reſt,</hi> into the poſſeſſion of thoſe glorious promiſes which we have long waited for: but now we are in a <hi>wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, we know not what to do,</hi> we know not what to ſay, we know not what to think, and our great Provocation is our <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>If we had Faith as a grain of Muſtard-ſeed, we ſhould remove mountains,</hi> we ſhould caſt out <hi>Devils.</hi> Every luſt is a mountain that ſtands up againſt the work of Reformation. And all unbelief is that dumb and deaf De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:59886:136"/>that caſts us ſo often into fire and water: now ſome <hi>Mountains,</hi> ſome <hi>Devils,</hi> are too hard for <hi>Ordinances,</hi> for Apoſtles themſelves if they were alive, only <hi>Faith</hi> calls forth the fulneſs of God in Jeſus Chriſt to overcome them.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 41.14, and 15. verſes, the Lord ſets a <hi>Worm</hi> on work <hi>to threſh the mountains.</hi> Alas! what proportion is there between a ſmall <hi>Worm,</hi> and a huge <hi>Mountain?</hi> But <hi>fear not, I am with thee</hi> (ſaith the Lord.) Here is a word for Faith to live upon, and to call out an Omnipotent arm to its aid, whereas our unbelief doth not only weaken us, but even Omnipotency it ſelf, as the Lord Chriſt ſaith, <hi>He could do no great thing in Nazareth, becauſe of their unbelief.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Beloved, if you would live as Brethren in love, peace and unity, then ſee that your Faith do call in <hi>God and his Chriſt</hi> unto the <hi>Treaty.</hi> See that your <hi>peace</hi> hath a <hi>word of Faith</hi> to bottom upon, otherwiſe every Storm will ſhake, if not overturn the ſandy foundation of it. <hi>All fleſh is graſs, and all the goodlineſs thereof is as the flower of the field. —The graſs withereth, the flower fadeth, but the word of our God ſhall ſtand for ever.</hi> There is more in one word of God to eſtabliſh a laſting peace and union among us, than in all the Counſels of periſhing Creatures, who look beſide it.</p>
                  <pb n="212" facs="tcp:59886:137"/>
                  <p>Had we <hi>Caleb</hi>'s <hi>ſpirit to follow God fully</hi> in the guidance and aſſurance of his Word, what a great meaſure of ſelf-denial and Chriſtian condeſcention might we obtain to work towards a Religious and a firm Peace and Unity. Whatſoever therefore you ſtrive againſt, ſtrive eſpecially againſt the unbelief of your own Hearts.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Againſt your Pride:</hi> This is a Proclaimed Rebel againſt Heaven; God will have no Peace with it. And little hope of a ſtable peace with men, if our Pride ſtands up to wage War with God.</p>
                  <p>He that ſerves his Luſts, will not ſpare any thing that may ſerve them, neither with <hi>Haman,</hi> the Blood of an whole Nation, nor with <hi>Abſalom,</hi> the blood of neareſt Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, nor with <hi>Herodias,</hi> the blood of moſt Eminent Miniſters, nor Conſcience, nor Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, nor Chriſt, nor God, nor any thing that will ſuit his Deſign.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Donatus</hi> was croſs'd in the Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick of <hi>Carthage,</hi> he turned Heretick, and fired the whole Empire with his Faction. I fear leſt Ambition and Malice have made many Malignants in theſe days. Shall I ſay as he, <hi>Fight not againſt ſmall nor great.</hi> No, fight againſt all your Luſts: But above all, againſt this great Luſt, this Pride of your Hearts, and againſt all thoſe <hi>Corruptions</hi> that
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:59886:137"/>ſtrengthen themſelves by it. O that I could in this prevail with you this day, <hi>fortior eſt qui ſe quam qui fortiſſima vincit maenia, He is ſtronger that ruleth his ſpirit, than he that winneth a City.</hi> Could you overcome theſe Luſts of yours, you may not only win a City, but preſerve and crown your own.</p>
                  <p>My Brethren, take heed how you ſerve their ends who do ſerve their own Luſts. How ſhould they govern you aright, that cannot govern their own Paſſions? Fleſhly Corruption will ever lay before us ſpecious pretences, in all thoſe ways into which our Pride or Paſſion doth prompt us; but Grace will ever have a jealous eye over them. I never ſuffered my Paſſion to work, but I ſuffered by it, and ſo undoubtedly ſhall all they which give way unto it.</p>
                  <p>I will only bring hither that paſſage of our Saviour in <hi>Luke</hi> 17. and the beginning of the Chapter, where he ſhews the danger of thoſe that give Offences, and the Duty of thoſe that ſuffer Offences.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, for thoſe that give Offences. (And mark your danger you that do it) <hi>It were better for him</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>that a Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone were hanged about his neck, and he caſt into the Sea, then that he ſhould offend one of theſe little ones.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="214" facs="tcp:59886:138"/>
                  <p>Secondly, for thoſe that ſuffer offences, your Duty is to forgive, and Chriſt well knowing how hard this Duty is to Corrupt Nature, how apt we are to make <hi>Peter</hi>'s Queſtion, <hi>How oft ſhall we forgive?</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>occupates this Objection, and tells us, that if every day our Brother ſhould offend us, and ſeven times in every day, and ſhould as often declare himſelf to be ſorry for his Offence, it is our Duty to forgive. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Apoſtles ſtartle, and cry out, <hi>O Lord increaſe our Faith;</hi> who hath Faith ſtrong enough to cloſe with ſuch a Duty as this? Our Faith can hardly work us to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give our Brother if he offends us but once; but if every day, and if ſeven times in every day he doth offend, where's the Faith that can maſter Paſſion ſo often to forgive?</p>
                  <p>Now, mark what Chriſt Anſwers, <hi>If ye had Faith as a grain of Muſtard-ſeed, ye might ſay unto this Sycamine Tree, Be thou plucked up by the Roots, and be thou planted in the Sea, and it ſhould obey you.</hi> Though Chriſt might point to a Sycamine Tree there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, yet doubtleſs, that which he did chiefly aim at, was this <hi>root of bitterneſs,</hi> that corruption which is naturally in every one of our Hearts, indiſpoſing us to Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation; whereby the work is as hard to forgive offences, as to root up ſpreading
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:59886:138"/>Trees. Now, if a grain of Muſtard-ſeed will ſtock up this bitter Root, and throw it into the Sea of forgetfulneſs, where it may never grow nor appear more; Oh, where is your Faith then! where is this grain of Muſtard-ſeed to be found? If ever the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick good did provoke us to exerciſe Faith in this Duty of forgiveneſs, now, even now it doth.</p>
                  <p>If the glory of one man of one Pariſh be great in paſſing by offences, how emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and exemplary will the glory of a City be?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To conclude,</hi> Dear Friends, keep your eyes, your ends, your aims Heaven-ward, Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, God-ward; and whatſoever is againſt Heaven, againſt Chriſt, or againſt God, be you againſt it: And whatſoever is for Hea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ven, for Chriſt, for God, be you for i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

In this City we ſhall receive high Dignity, conceive mutual amity, flouriſh in Eternity, ſhine in Charity, rejoyce in Piety; by know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God we ſhall ſee him, by ſeeing God we ſhall love him, and by enjoying God we ſhall praiſe him; we ſhall ſee God with Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, poſſeſs him with Conſolation, enjoy him with delectation.

                  <head>A Looking-glaſs for our <hi>Engliſh</hi> LADIES. OR, Daily Directions for their Dreſs and APPAREL.</head>

                     <salute>Vertuous Ladies,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>I <hi>Shall here give Directions to you for your Dreſs and Apparel, that ſo you may walk in this degenerate Age, as Women profeſſing Godlineſs; and not as thoſe that by their naked Breaſts and Fantaſtick Garbs are (and alas there is too many ſuch amongſt us) an Abomination to the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt then for the <hi>Time:</hi> Your Clothes may not be uſed every day alike; Times and Seaſons are to be obſerved. There is a time of Faſting and Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing when they muſt be laid aſide, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Practiſe of Gods Servants, who have clothed themſelves with Sack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth upon ſuch Occaſions, to ſignifie, that they were unworthy of the worſt Attire. And this did God give in charge to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that they ſhould <hi>put off their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:59886:177"/>from them, that he might know what to do unto them.</hi> In times of Mourning, then they are not fitting, courſer Attire is then beſt beſeeming; neither may be for every ordinary days wearing. In the days of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing and Publick Solemnity, theſe are fitteſt to be worn: For this was the Rich man in the Goſpel taxed, <hi>he was cloathed in purple and fine linnen every day.</hi> He is not ſimply condemned for wearing theſe, but for a daily uſing of thoſe coſtly Ornaments, making them, as it were, his Working-days Attire.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, for the <hi>Manner,</hi> we have the Apoſtles Rule, <hi>Adorn your ſelves in Modeſt Apparel, with ſhamefacedneſs and ſobriety,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>which becometh Women profeſſing Godlineſs.</hi> So then in Ornament, as in every thing elſe, our <hi>Godlineſs, Modeſty,</hi> and <hi>Sobriety</hi> muſt appear. It may not then be ſtrange or ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh (which argues neither Modeſty nor Honeſty, but Levity and Inconſtancy) but according to the ſober Cuſtom of our Countrey, from which we ſhould not vary; for how monſtrous and ugly is that part which agreeth not with the whole Body?</p>
                  <p>Neither may it be differing from our Sex, but according thereunto; <hi>The Woman ſhall not wear that which pertaineth to the Man, neither ſhall a Man put on a Womans Garment;
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:59886:177"/>for all that do ſo, are abomination to the Lord.</hi> The Law of Nature and common Honeſty condemns to have Women Manniſh, and Men Womaniſh in their Attire. Oh then our ſin!</p>
                  <p>Nor may it be above our <hi>Places, Callings,</hi> and <hi>Degrees.</hi> As God hath placed ſome Men above others, ſo ought Men to fit their Attire and Habit, according to the quality of the places wherein they are. So <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Ornaments were to put a difference between him and the Inferiour Princes of <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Court.</p>
                  <p>Neither may it be beyond our Means or Maintenance, but according to our Ability, in our places wherein we are: For to go as fine and coſtly as the foremoſt in our Rank, is not ſobriety: Our change and eſtates muſt be reſpected, and accordingly muſt we cut our Coat, and have our Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament.</p>
                  <p>Nor may they be the Ornaments of Light Houſe-wives, or of known diſſolute Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; it is not Modeſty for Women, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing the Goſpel, to go like Whores, or to imitate them in their Strumper-like be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour. Chriſtians ought not to ſeem to be ſuch as indeed they would be loath to be: Neither may it any way tend to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke inordinate deſires in our ſelves or
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:59886:178"/>others, but ſuch as may expreſs the Vertues of our Minds, being correſpondent to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency and Holineſs. Thus we ſee the Manner.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, for the <hi>Meaſure.</hi> Exceſs of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament is to be avoided, we may not have too many on our backs, nor in our Ward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>robes. <hi>Go to now, you Rich Men, weep and howl for your Miſeries that ſhall come upon you: Your Riches are corrupted, and your Garments are Moth-eaten, and ſhall not theſe Witneſs againſt you?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In Ancient times ſuch were counted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous as did exceed this way; ſo <hi>Graccus</hi> noted <hi>Naevius</hi> for a Licentious Fellow for having on his Hands more Rings than one. Beware then of exceſs in this kind, ſeeing both <hi>Heathen</hi> and <hi>Heaven</hi> doth condemn it. It is a ſin that goeth not alone, but draws many after it: For, firſt, exceſs in Ornament doth cauſe thee to abuſe thy Wealth, and makes thee ſpend it on needleſs and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous Uſes, when thou oughteſt to ſpend it better, as in Relieving of the Poor, and ſuch as are in want.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It is commonly maintained with Covetouſneſs and Injuſtice: When was more Pride and Bravery? And when more Oppreſſion and Cruelty? What greater cauſe of Bribing, and Extortion, of Fraud
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:59886:178"/>and Couſenage, of increaſing Fines, and inhauncing Rents, than this exceſſive Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very? <hi>Pride</hi> muſt be maintained, though it be with ſale of <hi>Faith, Conſcience, Religion,</hi> and all.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, It is a Thief of <hi>Time.</hi> Many a golden hour is ſpent in caſting how to be moſt brave, and what Faſhion doth beſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come them: And many an hour is ſpent in pranking and trimming of the Body, in the too accurate and curious culture of it. Had <hi>Plautus</hi> lived in theſe our times, he would never have wondred why dainty Dames are ſo long in trimming of themſelves, if he did but ſee what a ſhop of Vanities and Fooleries they bear about them. See here a cauſe, why ſuch as are moſt brave, are uſually moſt ignorant and impenitent: Alas, they have no time to adorn their Souls with Gods ſaving Graces; they dreſs themſelves by the Hour, and therefore can Pray but by the Minute; they want leiſure for the one, ſo much is taken up about the other.</p>
                  <p>And in a word, what more impoveriſheth the Common-wealth than our exceſſive Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very? Our Monies and our chief Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities are daily Tranſported into other Countries, and what comes in lieu thereof but <hi>Apes</hi> and <hi>Peacocks?</hi> Coſtly ſtuffs, ſilks, and velvets, gold and ſilver Laces, Feathers,
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:59886:179"/>and ſuch like Toys, for giddy pated Fools, which within a few days wearing, muſt be caſt off, and given to ſome Serving Man or Maid, and ſoon after become good for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but to adorn a Dung-hill. See then what a fruitful Mother of much Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs <hi>Exceſſive Bravery</hi> is. Let it therefore be avoided of all ſuch as bear any Love to themſelves or to their own Countrey.</p>
                  <p>The laſt Rule to be Obſerved, doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect the <hi>End,</hi> and that muſt be, not the priding up thy ſelf, or to cauſe the Eyes of others to be ſet upon thee, but Gods Glory, while thou doſt adorn his Temple: See then, that that be thy chiefeſt aim. And moreover look thou make a ſpiritual uſe of the Ornaments thou weareſt. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the Body is more worth than Raiment, and the Soul more worth than thy Body: Affect not therefore the Adorning of thy Body more than the Adorning of thy Mind; the Jewel is far more worth than the Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net wherein it's kept; and the thing covered is more to be reſpected than the Caſe that covers it. Again, let the Adorning of thy Body put thee in mind of thy ſhame and Nakedneſs, in reſpect of ſin. There is a Wound, elſe what needs a plaiſter? And theſe plaiſters, though they be of Silk or Velvet, argue, that under them are ſome
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:59886:179"/>loathſome ſores, which being ſeen, would ſhame us. Before Man ſinned, theſe Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments would have Adorned him no more than a ſilken caſe a ſweet Roſe; but when his Beauty became blemiſhed by ſin, then was he driven to ſeek for Ornaments, and on his <hi>uncomely parts to put on more comelineſs,</hi> ſupplying Natural defects with the helps of Art. Were this well conſidered, the beſt Ornaments would bring rather cauſe of bluſhing than of boaſting. Hath a Cripple, who hath loſt his Leg, any cauſe to brag of his wooden ſtump? Or a Thief any cauſe to boaſt of his Bolts, or glory in his brand and mark of Felony? What more cauſe have we to brag of Ornament? This is that which indeed ſhould humble us, as being a continual Teſtimony of our ſin and ſhame. Let us then uſe them as a daily Monitor, to put us in mind of our defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity by ſin, for our further humbling. And thus have we ſeen ſome ſpecial Rules to be obſerved in this particular of Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which being kept, we may ſafely and comfortably uſe our Liberty in this kind alſo.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But it may ſeem, that Ornament is Unlawful, and may at no hand be uſed: For the Apoſtles, both <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn all broidered Hair, Gold, Pearls, and
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:59886:180"/>other ſuch like coſtly Ornaments, as unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeming Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p>I Anſwer; neither <hi>Paul</hi> nor <hi>Peter</hi> do ſimply condemn the things themſelves, but the abuſe of them; they being uſed by Perſons of low Eſtate, and very mean Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, for of ſuch in thoſe days did the Church of God eſpecially conſiſt: And therefore howſoever it were Lawful in it ſelf, yet it was altogether unbeſeeming their Eſtate, being in them little better than Riot and Exceſs.</p>
                  <p>And Secondly, the Church was then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der grievous Perſecution: Now, at ſuch times our Ornament muſt be laid aſide (as formerly we have heard) that being a time of Humiliation and Mourning.</p>
                  <p>And thirdly, I Anſwer: The words are rather an <hi>Admonition</hi> than a <hi>Prohibition;</hi> he forbiddeth not the uſing of them, but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſheth them that they would rather adorn the inſide than the outſide, and be more careful of the Mind than of the Body; And this evidently appeareth by the <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis</hi> that is uſed in both places. <hi>Not with broidered hair</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi>) [But] <hi>with good works. Not that outward adorning</hi> (ſaith <hi>Peter</hi>) [But] <hi>let it be the hidden man of the heart:</hi> According to that ſaying of our Saviour Chriſt; <hi>Labour not for the meat that
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:59886:180"/>periſheth,</hi> [But] <hi>for that which endureth to eternal life:</hi> The meaning is, not ſo much for one, as for the other, deſire more the Adorning of the Mind than of the Body.</p>
                  <p>Again, ſome may demand, Whether it be Lawful to cover a deformity in the Body, or to mend the Complexion, it being leſs beautiful than others is? For, ſeeing the Body may be adorned with Ornament, it may ſeem that this alſo is tolerable.</p>
                  <p>But thus is this Queſtion anſwered; A deformity may be covered, but a new form may not be ſet upon the Face; neither a new Habit on the Body. The outward form and favour that man hath, is the work of God himſelf, fitted and proportioned unto man in his Conception, by his ſpecial Providence: Now, to take in hand to amend this favour, or proportion, that God hath given: What is it; but firſt, highly to diſhonour God, by preſuming to adulterate his work, taking upon them to amend that which as they ſuppoſe he hath made amiſs? Yea, ſecretly they tax him for want of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, when they thus go about to correct, had make that better, which God before had made: And can the Eternal God endure his?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, this is to lie to others, for they make themſelves to be other than God hath
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:59886:181"/>made them: They ſpeak in a real Language falſhood and deceit: A man may read a lie in their very foreheads. Their Favour is a lie, their Beauty is a lie, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Is it like there is truth in the inward parts, when they ſhew diſſimulation in their Faces?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, what is this but to be aſhamed of themſelves, and therefore being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed with their own colour and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, they come like Players, Masked, and diſguiſed? But art thou aſhamed of that Face that God hath made thee? Then be thou aſſured, God will be aſhamed of that Face thou haſt made thy ſelf: Thy ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs diſguiſing will bring it ſo to paſs, that the Lord when he comes to Judgment, will not acknowledge thee to be his Creature.</p>
                  <p>As for the defence that ſome do make for this their ſin, <hi>viz.</hi> it is to pleaſe their Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands. It is fond and fooliſh.</p>
                  <p>For firſt, thou oughteſt not to pleaſe man by diſpleaſing God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is but a deluſion of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, in making thee believe, thy Husband will love thee the better for thy painted Vizar; for indeed it is otherwiſe. Theſe Artificial ſupplies put thy Husband in mind of thy Natural defects; and this at length doth breed a greater loathing. I would ſuch as uſe theſe ſinful courſes would be
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:59886:181"/>more wiſe, and now at length renounce them: For aſſuredly it will turn to bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the end. And let theſe remember, who was the firſt that uſed this Plaiſtring, or Fainting; was it not <hi>Jezebel?</hi> And was not ſhe an arrant Whore? Let ſuch as would be ſo accounted, uſe it, but no other. And ſo I conclude this Subject.</p>

                  <head>The manner how the Duke <hi>de Guiſe</hi> Perſecuted the Miniſters, ſpoiled and defaced their Meetings (by break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down their Pulpits, rending the Seats, and battering the Windows thereof) in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time.</head>

                        <p>It is ſpoken according to our Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, for though God do never repent, (that is, change his Counſel) yet he doth as if he did repent, when he undoeth what he had before done. Nor may God be charged with changeableneſs, though the courſe of his Providence be turned, but the change is in us. You know the Sun by the ſame quality, and in the ſame ſeaſon, will ſoften Wax, and harden Clay, yea, will ſoften the earth when it is frozen, and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den it at other times, and yet the Sun never altereth his quality, but is ſtill the ſame: So though God be gracious to ſome, and ſevere to others, yea, ſevere and gracious to the ſame perſon at divers times, and in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent reſpects; yet he is one and the ſame for ever.</p>

                        <p>In Predeſtination two things are to be conſidered:
<list>
                              <item>1. <hi>Gods Preterition,</hi> paſſing by, or non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>electing of a perſon.</item>
                              <pb n="301" facs="tcp:59886:188"/>

                           </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>The former is of the meer pleaſure of God; for there can be no other Reaſon given, why this man is choſen, and that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed. Now thoſe whom God thus paſſeth by, through want of that aſſiſtance which he is not bound to give, fall finally from God, and ſo conſidered, are pre-damned, or fore-ordained to Deſtruction. God doth not force, or cauſe men to ſin, but leave them to it: For ſin being no poſitive thing, but a privation of what ſhould be; <hi>viz.</hi> of obedience, ariſeth from the inſufficiency of the Creature, left to it ſelf. If a King by his Wiſdom could foreſee, that divers of his ſubjects would prove Traytors, and be hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, unleſs he prefer them, and doth for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to gratifie them ſo far, only becauſe it is not his pleaſure ſo to do, can he be juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accuſed of the Treaſon which after they commit? I believe no Politition will affirm it: Muſt we then be ſo bold, as to charge him who is of purer Eyes than to behold iniquity, to be in any ſort the cauſe thereof, becauſe he doth not uphold us againſt it?</p>

Now though God made Angels and Men holy, he made them not Gods, that they ſhould ſtand of themſelves without his help, which when he withheld from man, and ſome of the Angels, they faltred in their obedience, and ſo became ſinful.</p>

<pb n="316" facs="tcp:59886:197"/>was called Judas one of the Twelve, went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, and drew near unto Jeſus to kiſs him.</hi> This Traitor is not a Diſciple only, but an Apoſtle; not one of the Seventy, but one of the Twelve. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſpeaks of many Offices of Love that Chriſt had done to <hi>Judas</hi> in eſpecial manner; he had called him to be an Apoſtle, made him his Friends; his Familiar, cauſed him to eat of his Bread, ſit at his Table, and to dip his hand in the Diſh with him; yea, if his Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition be true, Jeſus <hi>had delivered</hi> Judas <hi>of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten from death, and for his ſake healed his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of a Palſie, and cured his Mother of a Leproſie: and next to</hi> Peter, <hi>honoured him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all other his Apoſtles.</hi> Of this we are ſure, that he kiſſed him, and waſhed his feet, and made him his Treaſurer, and his Almo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; and that now <hi>Judas</hi> ſhould betray Chriſt: O how doth this add to the ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Chriſt, and to the ſin of <hi>Judas? Behold, a multitude,</hi> and <hi>Judas</hi> in the front: <hi>he went before them, tam pedibus, quam mori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus; in his preſence, and in his malice.</hi> The Evangeliſt gives the reaſon of this, that he might have the better opportunity to kiſs him, this was the Sign he gave the Rout; <hi>whomſoever I ſhall kiſs, that is he, lay hold on him;</hi> he begins war with a Kiſs, and breaks the peace of his Lord by a Symbol of Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:59886:197"/>Jeſus takes this ill; <hi>What,</hi> Judas! <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayeſt thou the Son of man with a Kiſs? q. d.</hi> What, doſt thou make the Seal of Love the Sign of Treachery? What, muſt a Kiſs of thy mouth be the Key of Treaſon? O what a friendly Reproof is here!</p>
                     <p n="2">2. For Chriſt's Apprehenſion; <hi>then came they, and laid hands on Jeſus, and took him.</hi> They apprehended him whom the World cannot comprehend; and yet before they took him, he himſelf begins the inquiry, and leads them into their Errand; he tells them that he was Jeſus <hi>of Nazareth whom they ſought:</hi> And now they have his leave, Oh with what fierce and cruel Countenances, with what menacing and threatning Looks, with what malicious and ſpiteful minds do they invade and aſſault our Saviour? they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſs him round; then they lay their wicked and violent hands upon him: in the Original, <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap> ſignifies a violent taking. One ſpeaks the manner of his Apprehenſion in theſe words; <hi>Some of them lay hold on his Garments, others on the hair of his head; ſome pluck him by the beard, others ſtruck him with their impious fiſts, and being enraged, that with a word he had thrown them backwards on the ground, they therefore throw him on his back, and baſely tread him under their dirty feet.</hi> Another Author gives it thus; <hi>As a
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:59886:198"/>roaring, ramping Lion draws along the Earth his Prey, and tears it, and pulls it; ſo they haled Chriſt all along the Earth, ſpitting, buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fetting, pulling him by the hair.</hi> Another in like manner thus; <hi>they all ruſh violently upon him, they fling him to the ground, they kick him, tear him, ſpurn him, pull of the Hair, both off his Head and Beard.</hi> Of every of theſe paſſages we find Scriptures full; <hi>Many Bulls have compaſſed me, ſtrong Bulls of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhan have beſet me round, they gaped upon me with their mouths, as a ravening and roaring Lion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. For Chriſt's binding, the Evangeliſt tells us, that <hi>the Band, and the Captain, and the Officers of the Jews took Jeſus, and bound him,</hi>

                        </gap> they bound his hands with cords; a Type of this was <hi>Samſon,</hi> whom <hi>Dalilah</hi> bound with Ropes; ſo they bound him with Ropes or Cords, fore-ſhewing hereby that he muſt dye, they never uſing to bind any with Ropes or Cords, but thoſe whom un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly they purpoſed to Crucifie: Some add the Circumſtances of this binding, that they bound him with three Cords, and that with ſuch violence, that they cauſed blood to ſtart out of his tender Hands; certainly they wanted no Malice, and now they wanted no Power, for the Lord had given himſelf into their hands.</p>
                     <pb n="319" facs="tcp:59886:198"/>

                     <p>And thus Chriſt underwent this Reſtraint, that all ſorts of perſecution might be Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to us by his ſuſception.</p>

<pb n="321" facs="tcp:59886:199"/>great Judge both of quick and dead.— In their proceedings, we may obſerve, 1. The captious Examination of the High Prieſt. 2. The Sacrilegious ſmiting of one of the Servants. 3. The Impious. Accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Witneſſes. 4. The Sentence of the Judges. 5.

                     <p n="1">1. For the captious Examination of the High Prieſt: <hi>The High Prieſt then asked Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus of his Diſciples, and of his Doctrine.</hi> 1. Of his Diſciples; what the Queſtions were, it is not expreſſed; but propably they might be ſuch as theſe; <hi>How many Diſciples he had? and where they were? and what was become of them? why he ſhould take upon him to be better guarded than others of greater place and calling? whether it did not ſavour of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and diſturbance of the State, to lead about ſuch a Crew of Diſciples and followers after him? and what was the reaſon of their flight? whether it were not a token of their guiltineſs of ſome diſorder, or of Riotous practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes?</hi> It is not for me to ſpeak how many Queries the High Prieſt might make to tempt Jeſus; but certainly he was ſifted to the bran, Examined to the full of all ſuch circumſtances as either might trap Chriſt, or in the leaſt degree advance and help for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:59886:200"/>his Condemnation; to this Queſtion concerting his Diſciples, our Saviour an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered nothing; alas he knew the frailty of his followers, he might have ſaid, <hi>For my Diſciples, you ſee one hath betrayed me, and another will anon forſwear me, he ſtays but for the crowing of the Cock, and then you ſhall hear him curſe and ſwear, that he never knew me; and for all the reſt, a pannick fear hath ſeized upon their hearts, and they are fled, and have left me alone to tread the Wine-preſs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. He asked him of his Doctrine; what his Queſtions were of that, are not ſet down neither; but probably they might be ſuch as theſe: <hi>Who was his Maſter, or Inſtructer in that new Doctrine he had lately broached? why he did ſeek to innovate, and alter their long practiſed and accuſtomed Rites? and what ground had he to bring in his own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices in their ſteads?</hi> And to this Queſtion our Saviour Anſwers; but Oh how wiſely! <hi>I ſpake openly in the World</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I ever taught in the Synagogue, and in the Temple, whither the Jews always reſorted; and in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret have I ſaid nothing; why askeſt thou me? ask them which heard me, what I ſaid unto them, behold they know what I ſaid: q. d.</hi> I appeal to the Teſtimony of the very Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies themſelves; thou ſuſpecteſt me to be a Seditious perſon, and one that plots Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief

<pb n="324" facs="tcp:59886:201"/>that he ſhould not live, but die; and now palliating their deſign with a Scheme of a Tribunal, they ſeek out for Witneſſes. O wonder! who ever heard that Judges went about to enquire for falſe Witneſſes, and ſuborned them to come in againſt the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner at the Bar? 2. <hi>Though many falſe Witneſſes came in to teſtifie againſt him, yet they found none;</hi> becauſe <hi>their Witneſs did not agree together.</hi> O the injuſtice of Men in bringing about the Decrees of God! the Judges ſeek out for Witneſſes, the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes are to ſeek for proof, thoſe proofs were to ſeek for unity and conſent, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was ready for their purpoſe. 3. At laſt, after many attempts, <hi>came two falſe Witneſſes, and ſaid, this fellow ſaid, I am able to deſtroy the Temple of God, and to build it in three days.</hi> They accuſe him for a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurative ſpeech, a trope which they could not underſtand; which if he had effected according to the Letter, it had been ſo far from a fault, that it would have been an Argument of his Power. Theſe were the Accuſations of the falſe Witneſſes, to all which <hi>Jeſus anſwered nothing;</hi> he deſpiſed their Accuſations, as not worthy an anſwer; and this vexed more. — But, 4. Another Accuſation is brought in; <hi>Caiaphas</hi> had a reſerve, which he knew ſhould do the
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:59886:201"/>buſineſs in that Aſſembly; he adjured him by God, to tell him if he were the Chriſt: <hi>I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou be the Chriſt the Son of God:</hi> The Holy Jeſus being adjured by ſo Sacred a Name, would not refulſe an Anſwer; but he confeſſed himſelf to be <hi>the Chriſt, the Son of the living God:</hi> And this the High Prieſt was pleaſed (as the deſign was laid) to call <hi>Blaſphemy;</hi> and in token thereof, he rends his Cloaths, prophetically ſignifying that the Prieſthood ſhould be rent from himſelf.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> We are taught in all this quietly to ſuffer wrong: <hi>If my Adverſary ſhould write a Book againſt me, ſurely I would take it upon my ſhoulder</hi> (ſaith <hi>Job</hi>) <hi>and bind it as a Crown to me;</hi> it is impoſſible, if we are Chriſt's Servants, to live in this World with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out falſe Accuſations: Come, let us take heart, and in ſome caſes, ſay not a word; ſince he that was moſt Innocent, was moſt ſilent, why ſhould we be too forward in our Excuſes? I know there is a time to ſpeak, as a time for ſilence; if it may tend to God's Honour, and to the ſpreading of God's Truth, and that right Circumſtances do concur, it is then time to open our mouths, though we let in death. So did our Bleſſed Saviour: O let us learn of him, and follow his ſteps!</p>

                     <p n="4">4. For the Doom or Sentence of theſe Judges; <hi>Caiaphas</hi> prejudging all the <hi>Sanhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drim,</hi> in declaring Jeſus to have ſpoken Blaſphemy, and the Fact to be notorious, he then asked their Votes; <hi>What think ye? And they anſwered, and ſaid, he is guilty of Death.</hi> They durſt not deny what <hi>Caiaphas</hi> had ſaid; they knew his Faction was very Potent, and his Malice great, and his Heart was ſet upon the buſineſs, and therefore they all conſpire, and ſay as he would have them, <hi>He is guilty of Death.</hi> Oh, here is Jeſus's Sentence, which ſhould have been mine, <hi>He is guilty of Death.</hi> But this Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence was but like ſtrong diſpoſitions to an enraged Fever; they had no power at that time to inflict Death, or ſuch a Death as that of the Croſs, they only declared him apt, and worthy, and guilty of Death.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. For <hi>Peter</hi>'s denial and abjuration: While theſe things were thus acting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Chriſt, a ſad Accident happened to his Servant <hi>Peter;</hi> at firſt a Damoſel comes to him, and tells him, <hi>Thou waſt with Jeſus of Galilee;</hi> and then another Maid tells the by-ſtanders, <hi>This fellow was alſo with Jeſus of Nazareth:</hi> And after a while, they that ſtood by, ſpake themſelves, <hi>ſurely thou art one of them, for thy ſpeech bewrayeth thee, q. d.</hi> thy very Idiom declares thee to be a <hi>Gali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lean;</hi>
                        <pb n="327" facs="tcp:59886:203"/>thou art as Chriſt is, of the ſame Countrey and Sect, and therefore thou art one of his Diſciples: <hi>Peter</hi> thus ſurprized, without any time to deliberate, he ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully denies his Lord: And, 1. He doth it with a kind of ſubterfuge, <hi>I know not what thou ſayeſt:</hi> He ſeems to elude the Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation with this. Evaſion, I know not thy meaning, I underſtand not thy words, <hi>I skill not what thou ſayeſt.</hi> 2. At the next turn, he goes on to a licentious boldneſs, <hi>denying Chriſt with an Oath, I know not the man;</hi> and laſtly, he aggravates his ſin ſo far, that he grows to impudence, and ſo denies his Lord with <hi>curſing and ſwearing, I know not the man:</hi> Here's a Lie, an Oath, and a Curſe; the ſin is begun at the voice of a Woman, ſilly Damoſel; not any of the greateſt Ladies, ſhe was only a poor Serving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid that kept the Doors; but it grew to ripeneſs, when the Men-Servants fell upon him; now he ſwears, and vows, and curſes himfelf <hi>if he knew he Man.</hi> O <hi>Peter,</hi> is the man ſo vile, that thou wilt not own him! Hadſt thou not before confeſs'd him to be the Chriſt, the Son of the living God? and doſt thou not know him to be Man, as well as God? Say, is not this the Man-God, God-Man that called thee, and thy Brother <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew,</hi> at the Sea of <hi>Galilee,</hi> ſaying, <hi>follow
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:59886:203"/>me, and I will make you Fiſhers of men?</hi> Is not this he whom thou ſaweſt on Mount <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor,</hi> ſhining more gloriouſly than the Sun? Is this not he whom thou ſaweſt walking on the water, and to whom thou ſaid'ſt, <hi>Lord, if it be thou, bid me to come unto thee on the water?</hi> How is it then that thou ſayſt, <hi>I know not the man?</hi> Surely here's a ſad example of human infirmity; if <hi>Peter</hi> fell ſo foully, how much more may leſſer Stars? And yet withal, here's a bleſſed example of ſerious, through Repentance; no ſooner the Cock crew, and Chriſt gave a look of <hi>Peter,</hi> but <hi>he goes out, and weeps bitterly.</hi> The Cock was the Preacher, and the look of Jeſus was the Grace that made the Sermon effectual. O the Mercy of Chriſt! he looked back on him that had forgot himſelf; he revives his ſervants memory, to think on his Maſter's words; he ſends him out to weep bitterly, that ſo he might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore him mereifully to his favour again.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. For the abuſes and deluſions of the baſe Attendants offered to Chriſt; the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſt tells us, <hi>then did they ſpit in his face, and buffetted him, and others ſmote him with the palms of their hands, ſaying, Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie unto us, thou Chriſt, who is he that ſmote thee?</hi> And as <hi>Luke</hi> adds, <hi>many other things blaſphemouſly ſpeak they againſt him;</hi> what
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:59886:203"/>thoſe many other things were, it is not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered; only ſome ancient Writers ſay, That Chriſt in that night ſuffered ſo many, and ſuch hideous things, that the <hi>whole know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of them is reſerved only for the laſt day of Judgment. Mallonius</hi> writes thus, <hi>after Caiaphas and the Prieſts had ſentenced Chriſt worthy of death, they committed him to their Miniſters, warily to be kept till day; and they immediately threw him into the Dungeon in</hi> Caiaphas<hi>'s Houſe, there they bound him to a ſtony Pillar, with his hands bound on his back, and then they fell upon him with their palms and ſiſts,</hi> Others add, that <hi>the Soldiers not yet content, they threw him into a ſilthy dirty puddle, where he abode for the remainder of that night.</hi> But we need not borrow light from Candles, or leſſer Stars, the Scripture it ſelf is plain: Obſerve we theſe Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. They ſpit in his face; this was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted among the <hi>Jews</hi> a matter of great Infamy and Reproach: <hi>And the Lord ſaid unto Moſes, if her Father had but ſpit in her face, ſhould ſhe not be aſhamed ſeven days?</hi> We our ſelves account this a great affront, and ſo did <hi>Job; I am their Song and their By word, they abhor me, they fly far from me, and ſpare not to ſpit in my face.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="330" facs="tcp:59886:204"/>
                     <p n="2">2. They buffet him: We heard before, that one of the Officers ſtruck Jeſus with the palm of his hand; but now they buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fet him: ſome obſerve this difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>; the one is given with the open hand, but the other with the fiſt ſhut up: and thus they uſed him at this time, they ſtruck him with their fiſts, and ſo the ſtroke was greater and more offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive: <hi>By this means they made his face to ſwell and to become full of Bunches all over.</hi> One gives it in thus; <hi>By theſe blows of their ſiſts, his whole head was ſwoln, his face be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came black and blew, and his teeth ready to fall out of his Jaws.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. They covered his face, <hi>Mark</hi> 14.65. Several Reaſons are rendred for it. As, 1. That they might ſmite him more boldly, and without ſhame. 2. That they might not have that object of Pitty in their view; it is ſuppoſed that the very ſight of his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable form, ſo lamentably abuſed, would have mollified the hardeſt heart under Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and therefore they veiled and hood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wink'd that alluring, drawing Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. They ſmote him with the palms of their Hands, ſaying, <hi>Propheſie unto us, thou Chriſt, who is he that ſmote thee?</hi> To paſs away that doleful, tedious night, they inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeably
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:59886:204"/>ſport at him; firſt one, and then another gives him a ſtroke (we uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly call it a Box on the Ear) and being hood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wink'd, they bid him <hi>a-read who it is that ſmote him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And now the diſmal Night is done, what remains, but that we follow Chriſt, and obſerve him in his Sufferings the next day! The Pſalmiſt tells us, <hi>Sorrow may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the Morning:</hi> only Chriſt can find none of this joy neither Morning nor Evening; for after a diſmal Night, he meets with as dark a day: what the paſſages of the day were, we ſhall obſerve in their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral hours.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Of <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Indictment, and <hi>Judas's</hi> fearful End.</head>
                     <p>ABOUT ſix in the Morning Jeſus was brought unto <hi>Pilate's</hi> houſe; <hi>then led they</hi> Jeſus <hi>from Caiaphas unto the Judgment-Hall, and it was early.—When the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was come, all the chief Prieſts and Elders of the people took counſel againſt Jeſus to put him to death; and when they had bound him, and led him away, and delivered him
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:59886:205"/>to</hi> Pontius Pilate <hi>the Governour. Then Judas which had betrayed him, hanged himſelf.</hi> O the readineſs of our nature to evil! When the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> would ſacrifice to the Golden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calf, rhey <hi>roſe up early in the Morning.</hi> If God leave us to our ſelves, we are as ready to practiſe miſchief, as the fire is to burn, without delay. But on this Circumſtance I ſhall not long ſtay; the Tranſactions of this hour I ſhall conſider in theſe two Paſſages, Chriſt's Indictment, and <hi>Judas</hi>'s fearful End.</p>
                     <p>In Chriſts Indictment, we may obſerve, 1. His Accuſation. 2. His Examination.</p>
                     <p>In his Accuſation we may obſerve, 1. Who are his Accuſers. 2. Where he was accuſed. 3. What was the matter of which they do accuſe him.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. His Accuſers were the <hi>chief Prieſts and Elders of the people;</hi> the very ſame that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ha judged him <hi>guilty of Death,</hi> are now his Accuſers before the Temporal Judge.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The place of the Accuſation was at the door of the Houſe; <hi>they would not go into the Judgment-hall, leſt they ſhould be defiled, but that they might eat the Paſsover.</hi> See what a piece of Superſtition and groſs Hypocriſie is here! they are curious of a Ceremony, but make no ſtrain to ſhed innocent Blood; they are preciſe about ſmall matters, but for the
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:59886:205"/>weightier matters of the Law, as Mercy, Judgment, Fidelity, and the Love of God, they let them paſs; they honour the figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative Paſsover, but the true Paſsover they ſeize upon with bloody and ſacrilegious Hands.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The matter of which they accuſe him. 1. That he ſeduced the people. 2. That he forbad to pay Tribute to <hi>Ceſar.</hi> 3. That he ſaid he was a King. How great, but withal, how falſe were theſe their Accuſations?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. For his Examination. <hi>Pilate</hi> was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing moved with any of the Accuſations, ſave only the third: and therefore letting all the reſt paſs, he asked him only, <hi>Art thou the King of the Jews?</hi> To whom Jeſus an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, <hi>My Kingdom is not of this World,</hi> &amp;c. He ſaith not, my Kingdom is not <hi>in this World,</hi> but my Kingdom is not of <hi>this World;</hi> by which <hi>Pilate</hi> knew well that Chriſt was no Enemy unto <hi>Ceſar:</hi> Chriſts Kingdom is ſpiritual, his Government is in the very Hearts and Conſciences of men, and what is this to <hi>Ceſar?</hi>—Hence <hi>Pilate</hi> u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth a Policy to ſave Jeſus Chriſt; they tell him that Chriſt was of <hi>Galilee,</hi> and therefore he takes occaſion to ſend him to <hi>Herod</hi> who was Governour of <hi>Galilee.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Pilate</hi> having diſmiſſed Jeſus, this hour is concluded with a ſad Diſaſter of wicked
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:59886:206"/>
                        <hi>Judas: Then Judas which betrayed him, when he ſaw that he was condemned, repented him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> &amp;c. Now his Conſcience thaws, and grows ſomewhat tender; but it is like the tenderneſs of a Boyl, which is nothing elſe but a new Diſeaſe. There is a Repentance that comes too late; <hi>Eſau</hi> wept bitterly, and repented him, when the Bleſſing was gone. The five fooliſh Virgins lift up their Voices aloud, when the Gates were ſhut; and in Hell men ſhall repent to all Eternity: and ſuch a Repentance was this of <hi>Judas;</hi> about midnight he had received his money in the houſe of <hi>Annas,</hi> and now betimes in the Morning he repents his Bargain, and throws his Money back again. The end of this Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy was, That <hi>Judas</hi> died a miſerable Death; he periſhed by the moſt infamous hands in the world <hi>(i.e.)</hi> by his own hands: <hi>he went and hanged himſelf.</hi> And as <hi>Luke, he fell headlong, and burſt aſunder in the midſt, and all his Bowels guſhed out.</hi> In every paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of his Death, we may take notice of Gods Juſtice, and be afraid of ſins; it was juſt that he ſhould hang in the Air, who, for his ſin, was hated both of Heaven and Earth; and that he ſhould fall down headlong, who was fallen from ſuch an height of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; and that the Halter ſhould ſtrangle that Throat, through which the voice of
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:59886:206"/>Treaſon had ſonnded; and that his Bowels ſhould be loſt, who had loſt the bowels of all Pity, Piety, and Compaſſion; and that his Ghoſt ſhould have its paſſage out of his midſt (he burſt aſunder in the midſt) and not out of his lips, becauſe with a Kiſs of his lips he had betrayed his Lord, our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Jeſus.</p>
                     <p>Here's a warning-piece to all the world; Who would die ſuch a death for the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of a little ſin? or who would now ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer for millions of Gold, that which <hi>Judas</hi> ſuffered, and yet ſuffers in Hell for thirty pieces of Silver? Now the Lord keep our Souls from betraying Chriſt, or any of his Children, and from deſpairing in God's mercy through Chriſt. <hi>Amen, Amen.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I ſee one ſand is run, I muſt turn the Glaſs; now was the ſeventh hour, and what were the Paſſages of that hour, I ſhall next relate.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> Of <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſtripped, whipped, clothed in Purple, and Crowned with Thorns.</head>
                     <p>ABout Nine (which the <hi>Jews</hi> call the third hour of the day) was Chriſt
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:59886:207"/>ſtripped, whipped, clothed with Purple, and crowned with Thorns; in this hour his ſufferings came thick. I muſt divide them into two parts, and ſpeak of them ſeverally by themſelves.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. When <hi>Pilate</hi> ſaw how the <hi>Jews</hi> were ſet upon his death, he conſented, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered him firſt to be ſtripped. <hi>Then the Soldiers of the Governour took Jeſus into the common Hall, and gathered unto him the whole band of Soldiers, and they ſtripped him.</hi> They pulled off his Clothes, and made him ſtand naked before them all. He that adorns the Heaven with Stars, and the Earth with Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and <hi>made coats of skins to clothe our firſt, Parents in,</hi> is now himſelf ſtripped ſtark na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Pilate</hi> gave him to be ſcourged; this ſome think he did upon no other account, but that the Jews being ſatiated and glutted with theſe Tortures, they might reſt ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and think themſelves ſufficiently a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged.</p>
                     <p>In this ſcourging of Chriſt, I ſhall inſiſt on theſe two things: 1. The ſhame. 2. The pain.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. For the ſhame: It was of ſuch Infamy that the <hi>Romans</hi> exempted all their Citizens from it. <hi>Is it lawful for you</hi> (ſaid Paul) <hi>to ſcourge a man that is a Roman?—And
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:59886:207"/>when the Centurion heard that, he went, and told the chief Captain, ſaying, Take heed what thou doſt, for this man is a Roman.</hi> The <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> looked upon it as a moſt infamous pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, fit only for Thieves and Slaves.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. For the pain: This kind of Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was not only infamous, but terrible; no ſooner the Soldiers had their Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but they charged, and diſcharged upon him ſuch bloody blows, as if he had been the greateſt offender, and baſeſt ſlave in all the World. <hi>Nicephorus</hi> calls theſe Whippers bloody Hang-men, by the fierceneſs of whoſe Whipping many had died under their Hands. The manner of their Whipping is deſcribed thus: <q>After they had ſtripped him, they bound him to a Pillar, whither came ſix young and ſtrong Executioners, Scourgers, Varlets, Hang-men (ſaith <hi>Jerome</hi>) to ſcourge him, and whip him while they could; whereof two whipped him with Rods of Thorns; and when they had wearied themſelves, other two whipped him with Ropes or Whip-cords, tied and knotted like a Carters Whip; and when they were tyred, the other two ſcourged off his very skin with Wires, or little chains of Iron; and thus they continued, till by alternate and ſucceſſive turns they had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſtripe upon ſtripe, and wound upon
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:59886:208"/>wound latter upon former, and new upon old, that he was all over in a gore Blood.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>I ſhall not contend about the number of his ſtripes, but this is certain, that the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, with violence and unrelenting hands, executed their commiſſion, they tore his tender fleſh, till the Pillar and Pavement were purpled with a ſhower of blood; and if we may believe <hi>Bernard,</hi>
                        <q>They plowed with their Whips upon his back, and made long furrows; and after that, they turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his back upon the Pillar, and whipt his Belly and his Breaſt, till there was no part free from his face unto his foot.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. They put upon him <hi>a Purple Robe,</hi> or <hi>a Scarlet Robe. John</hi> calls it <hi>Purple,</hi> and <hi>Matthew, Scarlet;</hi> howſoever ſome diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence may be, yet becauſe of their likeneſs, they are put ſometimes one for another; <hi>They put upon him a Scarlet Robe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. They platted <hi>a Crown of Thorns, and put it upon his head;</hi> a goodly Crown for the King of Kings, we read of many ſorts of Crowns, as of the Triumphal, Lawrel, Naval, Mural, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but never till this did we read of a Crown of Thorns; a Crown it was to delude him, and a Crown of Thorns to torment him; in this we may read both his pain and ſhame: 1. This Crown of Thorns boared his Head, ſaith <hi>Oſorius,</hi> with
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:59886:208"/>ſeventy and two Wounds; <hi>Bernard</hi> ſpeaks of many more, <hi>mille puncturis, &amp;c.</hi> I know not what ground they have to number them; but certainly many Wounds they made, and the rather may we ſay ſo; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that after they had put it upon his Head; <hi>they took a Reed and ſmote him on the head: (i.e.)</hi> they ſmote him on the head to faſten the Crown of Thorns upon him ſurer, and to imprint it deeper, till as ſome think it pierced his very Skull.</p>
                     <p>Now the hour ſounds again, and calls us to go forth, and to behold King Jeſus with the Crown wherewith he was Crowned in the Day of his Eſpouſals. And this we ſhall do the next hour.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> Of Chriſt brought forth, and Sentenced.</head>
                     <p>ABout Ten Chriſt was brought forth and Sentenced. 1. For his bringing forth, I ſhall herein obſerve theſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars. As —</p>
                     <p n="1">1. We find <hi>Pilate</hi> bringing forth Jeſus out of the Common Hall, and ſhewing this ſad ſpectacle to all the People; <hi>Then came
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:59886:209"/>Jeſus forth, wearing the Crown of Thorns, and the purple Robe, and</hi> Pilate <hi>ſaith unto them, behold the Man:</hi> He thought the very ſight of Chriſt would have moved them to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion; they had laſh'd him almoſt unto Death, they had moſt cruelly divided thoſe Azure Channels of his guiltleſs Blood, they had cloathed him with Purple, Crowned him with Thorns; and now they bring him out by the hair of the Head (ſay ſome) and expoſe him to the Publick view of the ſcornful Company.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. We find the Jews more enraged againſt Jeſus, <hi>When the Chief Prieſts and Officers ſaw him, they cryed out, ſaying, Crucifie him, Crucifie him.</hi> The more <hi>Pilate</hi> endeavours to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe them, the more were the people en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged againſt him; and therefore they cry, away <hi>with him,</hi> away <hi>with him; Crucifie him, Crucifie him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. We find <hi>Pilate</hi> and the Jews yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bating the buſineſs; <hi>Pilate</hi> is loath to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the Sentence, and the chiefeſt of the Jews provoke him to it with a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Argument. As—</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>They had a Law, and by that Law he ought to dye, becauſe he made himſelf the Son of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Jews come with another Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they threaton <hi>Pilate, If thou let this
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:59886:209"/>man go, thou art not</hi> Ceſar's <hi>Friend;</hi> a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible Reaſon, as the caſe then ſtood; it was no ſmall matter to be accuſed by ſo many audacious impudent men of High Treaſon againſt <hi>Ceſar,</hi> and therefore under this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation <hi>Pilate</hi> ſeems to bend and bow; whom the fear of Chriſt's Divinity had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained, him the fear of <hi>Ceſar</hi>'s frown pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked to go on to Sentence and Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. Oh, he was more afraid of Man, whoſe breath is in his Noſtrils, <hi>than of God himſelf, who made the Heavens, and framed the World.</hi> And yet before he gives Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, <hi>he takes Water, and waſheth his hands before the multitude, ſaying, I am innocent of the Blood of this Juſt perſon, ſee ye to it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. In reference to this they engage them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for him, which was their laſt Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>His Blood be upon us, and our Children, q. d.</hi> act thou as Judge, let him be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to dye, and if thou feareſt any<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thing, we will undergo for thee, let the vengeance of his Blood be on us, and on our Children for ever.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. For the Sentence it ſelf, <hi>When</hi> Pilate <hi>heard that,—he ſate down in the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-ſeat, in a place that is called the pave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> becauſe erected of ſtones; <hi>but in the Hebrew Gabbatha;</hi> — This word ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies <hi>an high place,</hi> and <hi>raiſed above;</hi> it was
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:59886:210"/>ſo on purpoſe, that the Judges might be ſeen of Men when they pronounced Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. And here <hi>Pilate</hi> ſitting down, he gave the Doom. What was the form, or manner of the Sentence is a great Queſtion amongſt Divines. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> is of the mind, that he pronounced no form at all, butonly <hi>delivered Jeſus unto them to be Crucified,</hi> Mark 15.15. John 19.16. Others cannot yield to this, for to what end (ſay they) ſhould he then <hi>ſit down upon the Judgment-ſeat?</hi> And yet amongſt themſelves they cannot agree on a form; <hi>Anſelme</hi> gives it thus, <hi>I adjudge Jeſus of Nazareth to that Ignominious and ſhameful Death of the Croſs. Vincentius</hi> thus, <hi>I condemn Jeſus, ſeducing the people, blaſpheming God, and ſaying, he was Chriſt the King of the Jews, to be faſtened to the Croſs, and there to hang till he dye.</hi> Many other forms are brought in by others, but that of <hi>Luke</hi> is, I am ſure, moſt Authentick. <hi>And</hi> Pilate <hi>gave Sentence, that it ſhould be as they required:</hi> And then <hi>he delivered Jeſus to their will.</hi> Here's a Sentence indeed, a delivery of Jeſus not to his own, but to his Enemies Liberty; to the boundleſs bonds, and all the poſſible Tortures of their own wills, and wiſhes. O unjuſt Sentence <hi>Give me not over to the will of my Adverſaries,</hi> cries <hi>David;</hi> the will of Malice is an endleſs
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:59886:210"/>wheel, it cares not how long it ſpins out pain, and therefore they cryed, <hi>Crucifie him, Crucifie him, let him be Crucified. Amen,</hi> (ſays <hi>Pilate</hi>) <hi>do what you pleaſe, Crucifie him, and Crucifie him as often as you will, it ſhall be as you require; Lo now I deliver him to your own will.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Much more might be ſaid, but the hour ſtrikes again; <hi>Pilate</hi> is now riſen, the Court diſſolved, and Jeſus is delivered into the hands of the Jews for Execution. How that went on, the next hour will ſpeak; only God prepare your hearts to hear de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voutly, and to conſider ſeriouſly, what Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus the great Saviour of the World hath ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for you.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> Of <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Crucifying, with its Appendices.</head>
                     <p>ABout Eleven, they prepare with all ſpeed for the Execution: in the revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of this hour we may obſerve theſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Paſſages. As, 1. Their taking off the Robe, and clothing him again with his own Rayment. 2. Their leading him away from <hi>Gabbatha</hi> to <hi>Golgotha.</hi> 3. His bearing
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:59886:211"/>the Croſs with <hi>Simon's</hi> help to bear it after him. 4. His comforting the Women, who followed weeping after him as he went. 5. Their giving him Vinegar to drink ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with Gall. 6. Their Crucifying, or faſtening him on the Croſs, whereon he dyed.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The Evangeliſt tells us, <hi>They took the Robe off from him, and put his own Raiment on him; Origen</hi> obſerves, <hi>They took off his Robes, but they took not off his Crown of Thorns;</hi> what ſerved their Intereſt, they purſued ſtill, but nothing of mitigation or mercy to the afflicted Son of Man.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>They led him away.</hi> Some ſay they caſt a Rope or Chain about his Neck, by which they led him out of the City to Mount <hi>Calvary,</hi> and that all along the way, mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes attended him, and a Cryer went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, proclaiming to all hearers the cauſe of his Death; namely, that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt was a Seducer, Blaſphemer, Negroman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, a Teacher of falſe Doctrines, ſaying of himſelf that he was the Meſſias, King of Iſrael, and the Son of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>He bore his Croſs.</hi> So <hi>John</hi> relates; before it bears him, he muſt bear it; and thus they make good their double cry, <hi>Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie him, Crucifie him;</hi> firſt, Crucifie him with it as a burthen, and then Crucifie him with it as a Croſs.</p>
                     <pb n="345" facs="tcp:59886:211"/>
                     <p n="4">4. He comforted the Women who fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed weeping after him as he went along. <hi>And there followed him a great company of people and of Women, which alſo bewailed and lamented him; but Jeſus turning to them, ſaid, Daughters of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>weep not for me, but weep for your ſelves, and for your Children.</hi> In the midſt of his Miſery he forgets not Mercy; in the midſt of all their Tortures and loudeſt out-cries of contumely, of Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy, of ſcorn, he can hear his follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Friends weeping behind him, and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect all his own ſufferings to comfort them, <hi>Weep not for me.</hi> He hath more compaſſion on the Women that follow him weeping, than of his own mangled ſelf, that reels along, fainting and bleeding unto death: He feels more the Tears that drop from their Eyes, than all the Blood that flows from his own Veins: We heard before that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he would not vouchſafe a word to <hi>Pilate</hi> that threatned him, nor to <hi>Herod</hi> that entreated him, and yet unaskt how graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly doth he <hi>turn about</hi> his bleſſed bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Face to theſe weeping Women, afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them looks, and words too, both of compaſſion and of conſolation, <hi>Daughters of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>weep not for me, but for your ſelves.</hi> —</p>
                     <pb n="346" facs="tcp:59886:212"/>
                     <p n="5">5. No ſooner he was come to the place of Execution, <hi>but they gave him Vinegar to drink mingled with Gall:</hi> In that they gave him drink it was an Argument of their Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity; this was a cuſtom amongſt <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> that to the Condemned they ever gave Wine to drink: <hi>Give ſtrong Wine unto him that is ready to periſh, and Wine un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thoſe that be of heavy heart.</hi> But in that they gave him Vinegar mingled with Gall, it was an Argument of their Cruelty and Envy.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. <hi>They Crucified him, (i. e.)</hi> they faſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him on the Croſs, and then lift him up. A great Queſtion there is among the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whether Chriſt was faſtened on the Croſs after it was erected, or whiles it was lying on the ground? I would not rake too much into theſe niceties, only more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable it is, that he was faſtened to it whiles it lay flat on the ground, and then <hi>as Moſes lifted up the Serpent in the Wilderneſs, ſo was the Son of Man lifted up.</hi> We may expreſs the manner of their acting, and his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings now, as a Learned Brother hath done before us; <hi>Now came the Barbarous inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Hangmen, and begin to unlooſe his hands, but how? alas, 'tis not to any Liberty, but to worſe bonds of Nails: Then they ſtript off his gore-glewed cloaths, and with them queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:59886:212"/>not a little of his mangled skin and fleſh, as if it were not enough to crucifie him as a Thief, unleſs they flea him too as a Beaſt; then ſtretch they him out as another</hi> Iſaac <hi>on his own burthen, the Croſs; that ſo they might take meaſure of the holes, and though the print of his blood on it gave them his true length, yet how ſtrictly do they take it longer, than the truth? thereby at once both to crucifie and rack him?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And by this time we may imagine Chriſt nailed to the Croſs, and his Croſs fixed in the ground, which with its fall into the place of its ſtation, gave infinite torture by ſo vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent a concuſſion of the Body of our Lord. That which I mean to obſerve of this cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifying of Chriſt, I ſhall reduce to theſe two heads, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſhame and pain.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. For the ſhame: It was a curſed death, <hi>curſed is every one that hangeth on a tree.</hi> When it was in uſe, it was chiefly inflicted upon ſlaves that either falſely accuſed, or treacherouſly conſpired their Maſters death: but on whomſoever it was inflicted, this death, in all Ages among the <hi>Jews,</hi> hath been branded with a ſpecial kind of Ignominy.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. For the pain: It was a painful death, that appears ſeveral ways; As— 1. His Legs and Hands were violently racked, and pulled out to the places fitted for his faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:59886:213"/>and then pierced through with Nails. 2. By this means he wanted the uſe both of his Hands and Feet, and ſo he was forced to hang immovable upon the Croſs, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unable to turn any way for his eaſe. 3. The longer he lived, the more he endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, for by the weight of his body, his Wounds were opened and enlarged, his nerves and veins were rent and torn aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and his blood guſhed out more and more abundantly ſtill. 4. He died by inch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meal (as I may ſay) and not at once, the Croſs was a death long in dying, it kept him a great while upon the Wrack, it was full three hours betwixt Chriſts affixion and expiration, and it would have been longer, if he had not freely and willingly given up the Ghoſt. It is reported, that <hi>Andrew</hi> the Apoſtle was two whole days on the Croſs before he died, and ſo long might Chriſt have been, if God had not heightened it to greater degrees of Torment ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> Of the Conſequents after Chriſts crucifying.</head>
                     <p>THE Particulars following I ſhall quickly diſpatch. As thus—</p>
                     <p n="1">1. About twelve, when the Sun is uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly brighteſt, it began now to darken. This darkneſs was ſo great, that it ſpread over all the Land of <hi>Jewry;</hi> ſome think, over all the World; ſo we tranſlate it in <hi>Luke, And there was a darkneſs over all the earth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. About three (which the Jews call the ninth hour) the Sun now beginning to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his light, <hi>Jeſus cried with a loud voice, Eli, Eli, Lamaſabachthani, my God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me? — And then, that the Scriptures might be fulfilled, he ſaid, I thirſt,—And when he had received the Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, he ſaid, It is finiſhed.—And at laſt cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with a loud voice, he ſaid, Father, into thy hands, I commend my Spirit, and having ſaid thus, he gave up the Ghoſt.</hi> I cannot ſtay on theſe ſeven words of Chriſt which he uttered on the Croſs; his words were ever gracious, but never more gracious than at this time; we cannot find in all the Books and Writings of men, in all the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:59886:214"/>and Records of time, either ſuch Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, or ſuch Sayings, as were theſe laſt Words and Wounds, Sayings and Sufferings of Jeſus Chriſt.—<hi>And having ſaid thus, he gave up the Ghoſt.</hi> Or, as <hi>John</hi> relates it, <hi>He bowed his head, and gave up the Ghoſt.</hi> And now we may ſuppoſe him at the Gates of Paradiſe, calling with his laſt Words to have them opened, <hi>that the King of Glory might come in.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. About four in the Afternoon he was pierced with a Spear, and there iſſued out of his ſide both blood and water. And <hi>one of the Soldiers with a ſpear pierced his ſide, and forthwith came there out blood and water.</hi> How truly may we ſay of the Soldiers, that <hi>after all his Sufferings, they have added wounds;</hi> they find him dead, and yet they will ſcarce believe it, until with a Spear they have ſearch'd for life at the well-head it ſelf.</p>

                     <p>ABout five (which the <hi>Jews</hi> call the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leventh and laſt hour of the day)
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:59886:214"/>Chriſt was taken down: And <hi>Mary</hi> cauſed certain Miniſters with whom ſhe joyned to take her dead Son from the Croſs, whoſe body, when ſhe once got free from the nails, ſhe kiſſed and embraced with entertainments of the neareſt vicinity that could be expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by a perſon that was holy and ſad, and a Mother weeping for her dead Son. She now bathes his cold Body with her warm Tears, and makes clean the ſurface of the Wounds; and delivering a winding Nap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin to <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea,</hi> gave to him in charge to enwrap the Body and embalm it, to compoſe it to the Grave, and do it all the Rites of Funeral. He obeys her Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, and ventures upon the diſpleaſure of the <hi>Jewiſh Rulers,</hi> and went confidently to <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,</hi> and begged the body of Jeſus; and <hi>Pilate</hi> gave it to him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Joſeph</hi> therefore takes the body, binds his face with a Napkin, waſhes the body, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noints it with Ointment, enwraps it in a compoſition of Myrrhe and Aloes, and puts it into a <hi>new Tomb</hi> which he for himſelf had hewn out of a Rock (it not being law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful among the <hi>Jews</hi> to inter a condemned perſon in the common Coemeteries) for all theſe circumſtances were in the <hi>Jews</hi> man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Burying.

I muſt needs confeſs, I have been ſo ſurprized with ſorrow my ſelf, that I thought it hardly poſſible for me to undertake this ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, but that I muſt have covered over my

                     <p>DEarly Beloved, the work in hand is a Funeral; the Party deceaſed, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy <hi>Samuel;</hi> the Mourners, all <hi>Iſrael;</hi> the place of Burial, his own houſe at <hi>Ramah.</hi> The whole paſſage penned, either by <hi>Gad,</hi> or <hi>Nathan</hi> (as it ſhould ſeem by the Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles) at Gods appointment, whoſe Eye follows every Mourner here, and therefore it behoves us to follow his voice with our beſt attentions. For my own part, I am very ſenſible of the Difficulties I now ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain for the ſubject of our Diſcourſe; <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muels</hi> Funeral is enough to aſtoniſh any <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelite:</hi> for matter, it is not eaſie to ſay,
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:59886:217"/>what will be moſt expediently ſaid; and for manner, we have things almoſt incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible to reconcile plainneſs and briefneſs in the ſame ſpeech. The Text gives ſome advantage by its plainneſs and fulneſs, yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing matter of large uſe from two ſorts of men of higheſt quality, <hi>viz.</hi> from <hi>Samuel</hi> dying, and from <hi>Iſrael</hi> mourning.</p>
                     <p>And firſt, of <hi>Samuel, he dies:</hi> And in his death let's read our own, and grow to this concluſion; Death is unavoidable, Life and Death take turns each of other; the man lives not, that ſhall not ſee Death, be he a King with <hi>Saul,</hi> a Prophet with <hi>Jeremy,</hi> a wiſe <hi>Solomon,</hi> a fooliſh <hi>Nabal,</hi> a holy <hi>Iſaac,</hi> a prophane <hi>Eſau,</hi> of what ſort ſoever, he muſt be Deaths Priſoner: Nay, let there be a concurrance of all in one, let <hi>Samuel</hi> be both a good Man, and a good Miniſter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and have as many Priviledges as are incident to a man, yet can he not procure a Protection againſt this Officer; his Mother may beg his Life, but none can compound for his Death. Speak we this according to men? ſaith not the Scripture as much? Wiſe men die (ſaith <hi>David</hi>) and Fools die; Rich men die, and poor too; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he calls both upon the Sons of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and of the Earth, to mind the Leſſon: indeed the Heathens could compare the Sons
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:59886:218"/>of <hi>Adam</hi> to Counters, Cheſs, Stage-plaies: in reckoning, Counters have their ſeveral Place and uſe for a time, but in the end they are all jumbled on a heap; in a Game at Cheſs, ſome are Kings, ſome Biſhops, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but after a while, they go all into the ſame Bag: on the Stage, one is in his rags, another in his Robes; one is the Maſter, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother the Man; and very buſie they be; but in the end the Play ends, the bravery ends, and each returns to his place: ſuch (and no other) is the ſtate of man. We wear death in our faces, and bear it in our bones, we put it upon our backs, and into our mouths, and cannot be ignorant of it. Yea, the dead proclaim this Leſſon, go to the Earth; and they that make their Beds in darkneſs, and ſleep in the duſt, will tell you, that its neither wiſdom, nor power, nor ſtrength, nor friends, nor place, nor grace, nor any thing elſe that can exempt from this Tribute of Nature. Our deceaſed Brother here before us, ſpeaks this to all this vaſt Aſſembly: <hi>If great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Spirit, feature of Body, gifts of mind, chaſtneſs of life, ſoberneſs in diet, diligence in a calling, Prayers of the Church,</hi> would have given any advantage againſt death, darkneſs and blackneſs had not at this time covered us. That there is no Preſcription againſt
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:59886:218"/>Death appears by theſe Reaſons. The firſt of which is taken from the Decree of God, its a Statute enacted in that higheſt Court, the voice of Heaven, that man ſhould once die. No man as yet hath breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but he hath had his death or tranſlation; no man is yet to come, but he muſt either ſee death, or an alteration; ſo hath Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven concluded it, and who can poſſibly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe it.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond is taken from the matter whereof all men are made; the Scripture compares man to a houſe, whoſe founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is laid in the duſt, whoſe walls are made of Clay, the whole is but a Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, and that of Earth, and that of mans building, as <hi>Paul</hi> (after <hi>Job</hi>) tells us: this is the eſtate of man, of all men; ſome are more painted than ſome, but all earthen Veſſels; ſome more clear than ſome, but all Glaſſes, all built of earth, all born of Women, and therefore all ſhort of conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance, as <hi>Job</hi> infers.</p>
                     <p>The third is taken from the proper cauſe of Death, <hi>Sin:</hi> Sin is Poyſon to the Spirits, Rottenneſs to the Bones, where it comes; and where doth it not come? And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now what's to be done?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. Surely as men that muſt travel, ſtand not to diſpute, but Arm themſelves for all
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:59886:219"/>Weather: So muſt we; die we muſt, that's already concluded; young and old, good and bad, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Whatſoever we be now, we muſt be dead anon: You will think ſtrange (perhaps) of my pains in this kind, whilſt I perſwade a Mortality: For howſoever we can all ſay in the general, we are Mortal, nothing ſo ſure as Death; yet when it comes to our own particular, we dream of an Immortality in Nature, we never ſet any bounds to Life, we do not reſolutely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, I muſt die ſhortly, I may inſtantly, this day may be the laſt that I ſhall ſee, this hour the laſt that I ſhall ſpend, this word the laſt that I ſhall ſpeak, this deed the laſt that I ſhall perform, this place the laſt that I ſhall breath in; and ſo live by the day, by the hour. But it is our duty daily to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what it is to die, what goes before it, what comes with it, what follows upon it: For firſt, before we come to the very Gate of Death, we are to paſs through a very ſtrait, long, heavy Lane: Sickneſs firſt tameth us, which many times is worſe than Death it ſelf, that renders us unfit for all Religious Services, Prayer, Repentance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as being a time not of getting, but of ſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; that cleaves the Head, and pains the Heart, and wounds the Spirits, and leaves us ſo diſtreſſed, that Meat is no Meat, the
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:59886:219"/>Bed no Bed, Light no Light to us; that makes us catch at Death for help: But alas, what help in Death, if not fore-thought of?</p>
                     <p>Oh the Miſery of a poor Creature, that is ſo pained, that he cannot live; ſo unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, that he dares not die! he goes to Bed, but cannot ſleep; he taſtes his Meat, but it will not down; he ſhifts his Room, but not his pain; Death (ſaith the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience) would end and amend all, wert thou prepared for Death; but to die before, were to loſe thoſe Comforts one hath, and to fall under thoſe Curſes that are unſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. Ah, beloved, we may intimate ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of his Miſery; but it falls not within our thoughts to conceive what his fears be, who hangs between Life and Death, Earth and Hell, thus forthwith ready to drop in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to flames at every ſtroke of Death, and to ſink down, down, down, till he be gone for ever. And yet this is not all: When I am dead (ſaith the Carnal wretch,) all the World have done with me: He ſaith truth, all the World, and all the comforts of the World have done with him indeed, he ſhall-never laugh more, he ſhall never have a moments eaſe more: But though the World hath done with him, yet God hath not done with him; he ſends for his Soul
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:59886:220"/>(having firſt taken order that the Body be forth coming) convents that, and dooms that, and caſts that from him with greateſt indignation, into ſuch a place, ſuch a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, ſuch a condition, as would make the Heavens ſweat, and the Earth ſhrink to hear it.</p>
                     <p>Ah, beloved, therefore without all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays, as a man that is now dying (as well as he for whom the Bell tolls, though not haply ſo near to Death) ſet upon two things: Firſt, ſet your Houſe in order, next your Souls. For the firſt, you have your perſons and things to look unto: To be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with Perſons; ſo live with your Wives, being Husbands, with your Servants, being Maſters, with your Children, being Fathers; as becomes dying Men, exerciſe ſuch wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, kindneſs, faithfulneſs, mercy, every day, as thou wouldeſt do, if thou knoweſt it to be the laſt day. And for things (mark me well) hearken not to Satan, who diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades all ſeaſonable wills, becauſe he would adminiſter the Goods; by being timely in this Errand, thou ſhalt not ſhorten thy days, but having taken thy leave of the World, ſhalt better attend on Death. Things there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore unlawful, reſtore, (I ſay again) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore. Things Lawful diſpoſe of, and as in a Journey (haſty and uncertain) wait
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:59886:220"/>the Call. Up then (my Brethren) and loſe no time: Now the Wind ſerves, hoyſe up Sail; now is the Market, make your Proviſion; now is the Seed-time, ſow a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pace; as yet you have all Advantages from Grace and Nature, Word, Sacrament, Wit, Memory, Senſe, Strength, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the Opportunity, Repent and be Pardoned; believe, and be ſaved; obey, and be for ever bleſſed: If any hath per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded himſelf otherwiſe, my Soul ſhall weep in ſecret for his deſtruction, which I know will be as certainly effected, as now it is plainly threatned. Be entreated then, let God entreat you, and once over-rule you: You muſt die, you muſt die but once; being once dead, you return not to make a new Preparation; do that once well, which being once well done, will make you Men nay, more than Men, than Angels for ever. And this is the Uſe for your ſelves. A ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond reſpects our Friends.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. Muſt all die, is there no Remedy? Then muſt we have patience in our Friends departure: a common Lot no man ſhould ſhrug at, even in the Poets judgment: who quarrels Summer for ſome heat, or Winter for ſome cold? a Thorn for pricking, or a Brier for ſcratching? who is angry that he is framed like other men, ſubject to like
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:59886:221"/>hunger, like thirſt, like ſleep? and why (I pray) ſhould not our Friends reſemble others in their death, as well as in their birth? We would not have them have more Eyes or Hands than others, and why more days? What do we make of Life, what of Death? Surely to the godly, Life is but a Priſon, Death is an Advantage. Say our Friends were tyed in Priſon, would we begrudge them liberty? ſay toſs'd on the Seas, would you envy them the Haven? ſay doubtful in the Skirmiſh, would you be ſorry for their Victory? nay, ſay but bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with a Tempeſt, would you not wiſh them at home? Believe it, Brethren, this World is but a Sea, a Priſon; this Life a Journey, a Warfare: if God hath prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our Wiſhes, ſhall he be returned fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs? Shall we trouble the Air with needleſs Crys, my Husband; my Father, my Father; as if we were the firſt Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows and Orphans in the World? No, let them mourn without hope, whoſe life and death is without hope: as for Chriſtians, who die living, and live dying, they loſe nothing by death.</p>
                     <p>For firſt, if we deſcend to particulars, the body that is ſtript of all ſinful and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural defects (the abortions of ſin) and filled with all heavenly contemplations:
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:59886:221"/>of mortal, it becomes immortal; of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible, incorruptible: there is no uſe of Meat, Apparel, Sleep, Beds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable, glorious; like (in its meaſure) to the body of Chriſt, which is the ſtandard. In ſhort, whatſoever might make to the annoying, blemiſhing, diſhonouring, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieting of the body, is removed: whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever might make it amiable, active, honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, glorious, comfortable, is added: the glory of the Sun will be but darkneſs to it. <hi>For the Soul,</hi> that is firſt eaſed of all the rags and relicques of ſin, delivered of Ignorance, Pride, Self-love, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> delivered next, of all the conſequences of ſin, griefs, guilts, fears, accuſations, yea, delivered of all things, which may any way import an imperfect ſtate through an upright heart, as Faith, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, hungering after Righteouſneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And then in a ſecond place, it is filled with the Image of Jeſus Chriſt. Firſt, all the powers and faculties thereof are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected and advanced above the ordinary ſtrain of Nature: Next all thoſe Veſſels are ſtuffed with knowledg, love, and all things elſe that are there requiſite; and not only ſo, but the Soul is furniſhed with all the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendances of Chriſts Image, everlaſting joy, perpetual peace, a conſtant correſpondency and communion with God; and in brief,
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:59886:222"/>whatſoever might offend, ſtain, blemiſh the Soul, is removed; and whatſoever might enrich it, ennoble it, and make it bliſsful, is (according to each mans meaſure) added: And thus of the perſon. The reſt we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch with all ſpeed: For the Eſtate thus: there ſhall be nothing that ſhall be wanting, that ſhall trouble, diſtract, or diſcontent; there ſhall be nothing that the Soul ſhall then deſire, but there it is. For the place thus: There ſhall be nothing leſs, than what ſhall be deſired, nothing more that can be deſired; what it is, the Word no where (for ought I know) tells us. The Church on Earth is more rich than Gold, more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious than Pearl, more bright than the Sun, more glorious than the Moon: but what is there to be ſeen, <hi>Paul</hi> could not utter, we cannot conceive; only this we know, that none ſhall be ever weary of it, or willing to alter it. Laſtly, for the Company, there be of three ſorts. Firſt, <hi>Angels,</hi> who ſhall not then terrifie, but attend; the worſt and loweſt Servant there ſhall be an Angel. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, all the famous and godly men that ever lived; there ſhall we meet with <hi>Adam, Abraham,</hi> &amp;c. there ſhall we be acquainted with <hi>David, Paul,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Cypr. de morte ad Fratres.</note> &amp;c. Thirdly, the bleſſed Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; there ſhall we ſee him who
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:59886:222"/>hath done and ſuffered ſo much for us; him whom the Fathers before and ſince his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation, ſo much longed to ſee, Jeſus Chriſt the bleſſed: all which conſidered and believed, what can we leſs do, than aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don all fruitleſs and fleſhly tears for our Friends departed? what way are they gone, but the way of all fleſh? with whom do they live, but with <hi>Samuel,</hi> with God? Where are they, but in better place and caſe? with better Friends than ever before. In ſtead of carking, therefore, do two other things: Firſt, whilſt Friends be preſent, do the part of a Friend, in praying for them, in calling upon them, and in fitting of them to death; that ſo thou mayſt have peace in thy ſelf, and hope of them in their depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: elſe, when thy Conſcience ſhall ſay unto thee; Wretched man, thy Wife, thy Child, thy Charge is now dead, and (for ought thou knoweſt) in Hell, if not, no thanks to thee, for thou waſt never the man that would call upon them, pray with them, or mind them of their Departures: when (I ſay) thy Conſcience ſhall thus great thee, thou ſhalt not tell how to take it. Secondly, when they are gone to bed, and faſt aſleep, awake them not with thy cries, but make ready to follow after; ſo the time ſhall be beſt redeemed, the loſs and
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:59886:223"/>croſs beſt improved, and Satan (who loves to fiſh in ſuch troubled waters) moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented. And ſo far this Uſe.</p>
                     <p>We will touch upon a third as we paſs, and that is this: Muſt we all die? then here is a cooler for the wicked, and a comfort for the godly. The wicked holds all his comforts only for term of life; death ends his wealth, his glory, his peace, his joy, his comforts, his contentments; all his por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions is only in this life, ſaith the Prophet; all the ſweet he hath fore-goeth death: af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he hath a Portion indeed, but it is a Portion of Fire and Brimſtone, of Storms and Tempeſts, of Anguiſh and Tribulation, of Shame and Confuſion, of Horror and Amazement in a fiery Lake from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God, in the midſt of curſed Spirits. Thus death muſt needs be terrible to him, but as comfortable to the Godly; for it makes his Croſſes as ſhort, as the others Comforts: The Wicked cannot promiſe to himſelf Comforts of an hours length, nor may the Godly threaten himſelf with Croſſes of an hours continuance. Death in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant turns the ſinners Glory into Shame, Pleaſure into Pain, Comfort into Confuſion: Death in an inſtant eaſes the Godly's body of all pain, his Soul of all ſin, his Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of all fears, and leaves him in an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:59886:223"/>of perfect happineſs. And happy are they whoſe Miſery is no longer than life; but woe be to the wicked, whoſe jollity ends when death enters, and whoſe Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſurvive death it ſelf: and ſo we leave <hi>Samuel</hi> to his reſt.</p>
                     <p>Well, <hi>Samuel</hi> is well himſelf, but in what caſe doth he leave his poor Neighbours at <hi>Ramah?</hi> that the Text now ſpeaks, and it is my trouble (yet better one than all troubled) that I muſt ſpeak it ſo briefly: <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſaith the Text, <hi>Jacobs</hi> iſſue, Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; all <hi>Iſrael</hi> diſtributively taken, that is, of all ſorts ſome, were gathered in great Troops, either by publick command, or of their own voluntary accord, or both ways: Firſt, to lament, according to the then cuſtom in moſt ſolemn manner, <hi>Samuels</hi> end, and their own loſs; and next (to honour him at his Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial in <hi>Ramah.</hi>) The Points, which in a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage or two muſt be touched from this part, are two; the firſt is this; <hi>Samuel</hi> a publick and a profitable man dieth, <hi>Iſrael</hi> publickly mourneth: you ſee what followeth, <hi>Great and publick loſſes muſt be entertained with great and publick ſorrows:</hi> Sorrow muſt be ſuited to the loſs, as a Garment to the body, a Shoe to the foot; when the cauſe of Grief is great, the meaſure of Grief muſt be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable. This is one Principle, when a
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:59886:225"/>good man and Neighbour dies, there is cauſe of great forrow: this is another, the inference will ſoon follow, and reſult hence, and that is our Concluſion; <hi>Good men of publick uſe and place, ſhould never paſs to the Grave unlamented, their death ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered and bewailed.</hi> And indeed, reaſon calls for it; for we muſt mourn, in reſpect of the cauſe of ſuch mens deaths; not pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, but publick ſins too; God never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads a State, a Country, but for ſome Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reaſon</hi> 1. If <hi>Samuel</hi> die, it is becauſe God is angry with the people: the ſheep be not thankful nor fruitful; therefore the ſhepherd is ſmitten.</p>
                     <p>Now ſhould it be thus when uſeful per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons die? what then ſhall we ſay to theſe times, wherein men have not put off Piety only, but Nature alſo? No marvel if the Prophet complain, <hi>The righteous periſh, and no man conſidereth it in his heart.</hi> The wife periſheth, and the Husband doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it; the Parents periſh, and the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren do not conſider it; the Children periſh, and the Parents do not conſider it; few ſuch Brethren as <hi>David</hi> to <hi>Jonathan;</hi> ſuch Husbands as <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſuch Children as <hi>Iſaac,</hi> ſuch Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers as <hi>Jacob.</hi> Theſe long and long felt the loſs of their deareſt Friends: but now
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:59886:225"/>one month is enough to wear out all thoughts of a Brother, nay, of a Child, nay, of a Mother, nay, of a Wife; nay in the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt tyes, one in that ſpace may be buried, a ſecond wooed, a third married. Hitherto, in hardeſt preſſures, and worſt meaſures, <hi>David</hi> could go to <hi>Samuel</hi> in <hi>Ramah,</hi> and there meet with good Counſel and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort: but now both <hi>Samuel</hi> himſelf dies, and poor <hi>David</hi> muſt flie. Shall (I belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved) ſpeak as the thing is? In the fall of one Cedar of <hi>Ramah</hi> we have loſt much ſhade and ſhelter; in the ſplitting of one Veſſel of price (wherein we had all our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſſes and adventures) we are all loſers: what we have loſt we ſhall better ſee ſeven years hence, than now; but loſers we are, all loſers; Wife, Children, Neighbours, Friends, Miniſters, People, all loſers; ſo that here that is verified, which was anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently uttered of another, <hi>In one we have loſt many; a chaſt Husband, a tender Father, a religious Miniſter, a kind Neighbour,</hi> in few, <hi>a Samuel.</hi> Speak I this after the fleſh, to pleaſe? No, I ſpeak it for uſe to profit: I report my ſelf to your hearts. You tell me that you have a publick loſs, your mouthes have uttered it, your faces ſpeak it, my Ears and Eyes have received it from you; and if ſo, then ſee what follows; if
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:59886:226"/>we have <hi>Iſraels</hi> loſs, we muſt make <hi>Iſraels</hi> Lamentation. Let us take up <hi>Davids</hi> words with <hi>Davids</hi> Affection; I am diſtreſſed for thee, Brother <hi>Jonathan,</hi> very pleaſant haſt thou been to me, thy love to me was won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful, paſſing the Love of Women. Are we as <hi>David</hi> to <hi>Saul, Iſaac</hi> to <hi>Rebekah,</hi> ſons? Are we as <hi>Jeremiah</hi> to <hi>Joſiah,</hi> Prophets? As <hi>David</hi> to <hi>Abner,</hi> Kindſmen? Are we by any name entituled to this loſs? Mourn then, mourn, not as the Infidel deſperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, nor bitterly, as doth the froward; but ſoberly, as did <hi>David,</hi> when <hi>Abners</hi> Death put him to a Faſt. Let his deareſt Yoak-fellow ſay, Ah, mine unthankfulneſs and unfruitfulneſs! let Children ſay, Ah, our Diſobedience and Stubbornneſs! and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, Ah, our Idleneſs and Untruſtineſs! and all, Ah, our Folly and Frowardneſs! who could not ſee Vertves through Frailties, and Corn through chaff, till we had loſt all. Theſe ſins of ours have ſtrip'd us of a <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel,</hi> and covered us with darkneſs. He is gone; the Arm and Shoulder is faln from this our little body, the ſooner for our ſins; let us ſee it, or elſe what abides us? In the Body, what Medicines cannot do, cutting muſt; what that cannot, burning muſt, or elſe nothing (ſaith the Maſter of Phyſick) It is ſo in the Soul too; Oh that we could

A Godly fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Life hath a fairer proſpect towards Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, than all the Advantages in the World beſides. Be one as poor as <hi>Oneſimus,</hi> yet if <hi>Oneſimus,</hi> that is, Profitable, his Name out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lives him: Be one as great as King <hi>Jehoram,</hi> or <hi>Jehoiachim,</hi> if he idle out his Life, he lives undeſired, he dyes unlamented. What we hear ſpoken, we ſee executed in all Ages. Conſult with your own Experience, and tell me, whether the Names of Idolaters, Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards, Adulterers, Swaggerers, be not rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and accurſed, in deſpite of all Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Titles, Offices, Policies, Favours whatſoever: When in the mean time the Righteous (notwithſtanding all ſlanders, clamours, imputations, and aſperſions) is of bleſſed Name and Memory. And if ſo, feed upon the Wind no longer, build <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels</hi> no more, lay no more Foundations in Hell, whilſt you think to erect a Building
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:59886:229"/>by flattery, baſeneſs, dependency, lying, ſwaggering, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but go to the Lord of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, for laſting Honour; Pray much, Read much, Hear much; Honour him in all the paſſages of his Worſhip, and you have his word for your Preferment: And as for men, be to them as <hi>Jehoiada</hi> was, profitable, and they ſhall be to you as <hi>Iſrael</hi> to him, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful. Ah, the fruitful liver finds Mercy in his death, his Conſcience favours him, and heartens him upon death it ſelf: The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels of God (thoſe Officers of Heaven) comfort him, and fetch him in all ſtate to his Crown; the Lord of Glory receives him with all Honour, and puts upon him the Glory of Heaven; the Saints departed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard him as a part of themſelves, of Chriſt; the Saints living honour his Name, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him to Heaven, with their Loves and Affections: The wicked have a world of Commendations for him, and the blind <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam</hi> can ſay, <hi>O that my end may be like his!</hi> Thus Honour and Happineſs (and nothing elſe) abide us hereafter, if now we can lay forth our ſelves to God and Mans Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. But for the wicked, who beſtow themſelves in the World, like Drones in the Hive, who either have no Calling, or do no Service, and towards God ſo demean themſelves, as if they were his betters;
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:59886:229"/>ſcorning his Children, ſcoffing at his Word, trampling upon his Name, his Sabbaths, his Worſhip; let them never deceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, their Names ſhall rot, they ſhall find no favour in Death, their Conſciences ſhall brawl them out of all quiet: Men ſhall rifle into their lives; their whoredoms, treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, villanies ſhall flie thorow the world; every Drunkard ſhall ſit upon them, every rake-hell judge them, cenſure them, and deride them. In the mean time whilſt that the Name is thus <hi>torn</hi> below, the Soul is brought before the Judge, Convicted, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to Hell, covered with ſhame, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered up to everlaſting contempt. O then, be not curſed, but bleſſed; be Happy, be Honoured, be well thought of in Life, well ſpoken of after Death; be Righteous, be Humble, be Serviceable; this is the way as Heaven tells us; a <hi>Samuels</hi> Life will draw on a <hi>Samuels</hi> Death, nothing elſe.</p>
                     <p>In a ſecond place, let this afford comfort to fruitful Members, and faithful Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans: Let them know that the World will change ere-long; the wicked, who have now the applauſe, muſt down; the godly, who are as yet under ſhame, ſhall one day ſhine as ſo many glorious Suns in the higheſt Heavens. Yield then (beloved) to the Worlds Sons; let them have the place, give
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:59886:230"/>them leave to ſpeak; the time will come when Honour ſhall know its home, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency have its Crown: All the wiles in the World ſhall not keep the wicked from contempt; nor all the wits in Hell the Godly from Honour. <hi>Samuels</hi> Name may be over-caſt and clouded for a time, but in the end his light will ſhew it ſelf. Whilſt he is preſent, he is not valued; but this is <hi>Samuels</hi> Honour, when gone, he is miſt; when dead, he is lamented; all <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſtrives to do him all Honour: Bleſſed be that Life, that ends in ſo glorious a death; thrice hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py that Man, whom Angels, God, and all Men do ſtrive to Honour. A true Chriſtian may travel in life under Troubles and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts; but marke his end, and you ſhall find (as Peace, ſo) Honour. When he is Buried, a true and honourable <hi>Funeral</hi> is Solemnized; men mourn, not in the Face, but in the Heart; reſpect him not in ſhew, but in truth; their Conſciences Reverence him, their Souls find a miſs of him, the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels of Heaven man him in a goodly Train to Heaven, the Saints on Earth follow him with greateſt Affections to his Grave: <hi>Seven, nay, thrice ſeven Years after the Funeral he is not forgotten.</hi> Thus are the men whom the great King loves, <hi>Honoured.</hi> And now, ſhall Men and Women bear with patience
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:59886:230"/>the abſence of deareſt Friends, when it is for their outward preſerment? And when Chriſt would Marry a Child, prefer a Friend, advance our Acquaintance, ſhould we ſtand off? No: If this be the worſt that Death can do to the Godly, to ſtrip him of his Rags, and cloath him with Robes; to free him from all contempts, and poſſeſs him of greateſt Honours; to redeem him from all ſhame, and to Crown him with Glory in the Hearts, Mouths, Conſciences of Men, in the face of Heaven and Earth: Let's ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver frown upon Friends departure, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſee (if poſſible) the Meſſenger of this good tidings, and bleſs the Lord for our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement in theirs. Indeed (beloved) we weep too faſt, when tears deny ſight of Mercies: In the death of <hi>Samuel</hi> there is gain to him, as well as loſs to us; both ſhould be remembred. I know many preſent to be ſenſible of the one; I ſhall be wrongful to conceal the other. Truth it is, there is fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len a great Man in <hi>Iſrael:</hi> But how fallen? Like <hi>Abner,</hi> upon a violent Hand? Or dyed he like a Fool? Was he unſenſible of his Eſtate? Were his Hands, his Mouth, his Heart tyed? Was his end without Honour? No, Brethren, he died in a ripe Age, when the Lord had made the moſt of his Life; he died in Peace, he died with hopes of Life
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:59886:231"/>in his heart, with words of Grace in his lips, and his Sun did ſet in the higheſt point, in greateſt brightneſs; time, place, manner, company, Men Angels, God, and all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired together, to do him all Honour in his death. Bleſs the God of all ſpirits for this, all ye that are Intereſſed in the ſame Profeſſion and Religion. Bleſs the Lord for this, that he ſo died, in ſuch a place, in ſuch a time, in ſuch a ſort, as the Devil hath received a foil, and Religion grace and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour by it. <hi>And thus</hi> Iſrael <hi>hath done his part in Mourning, in Burying</hi> Samuel <hi>at his Houſe at</hi> Ramah.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And now the more particular Application of all this brings me directly to the ſad occaſion of this preſent Meeting, even to lament the fall of that Choice and Excellent Perſon, Mr.</hi> John Dunton, <hi>in whoſe Death the Almighty teſtifies againſt us, and even fills us with Gall and Wormwood; I know you come hither to mourn, ſo fully prepared for it, that although I am but a dull Oratour to move Paſſion, I may ſerve well enough to draw out thoſe Tears wherewith your Hearts and Eyes are ſo big and full: There is no need to call for the Mourning Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, that they may come; and for Cunning Women, that they may take up a wailing to help your Eyes to run down with Tears, and your Eye-lids to guſh out with Waters. The very
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:59886:231"/>looking down upon this Bier, and the naming of the Man, whoſe Corps is here placed, and a very little ſpeech of his Worth and our miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Loſs, is enough to make this Aſſembly</hi> (<hi>like</hi> Rachel) <hi>not only to lift up a voice of Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but even to refuſe to be Comforted.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Dearly Beloved, I muſt needs confeſs I am this day called to ſpeak of a Man ſo eminent and excellent, ſo wiſe and gracious, ſo good and uſeful, whoſe Works ſo praiſe him in every Gate, that if I ſhould now altogether hold my Tongue, the Children and Babes (I had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſaid the ſtones) would ſpeak; upon whoſe Herſe could I ſcatter the ſweeteſt Flowers, the higheſt Expreſſions of Rhetorick and Eloquence, you would think I fell ſhort of his worth; you would ſay, his very Name expreſſeth more than all my words could do. Should I ſay of him, as they of</hi> Titus, <hi>that he was</hi> Amor &amp; Deliciae generis Humani: <hi>Should I ſay of his Death, as once the</hi> Sicilians <hi>upon the</hi> Grecians <hi>depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> Totum ver periit ex anno Siciliano; <hi>ſhould I ſay he was not only as one of</hi> David's <hi>Thirty Worthies, but one of the three, one of the firſt three, even the firſt and Chief of them; the only Man in theſe Parts, who Preach'd as he liv'd; ſhould I ſay our whole Land groaneth at his Death, as the Earth at the fall of a great Mountain, I might do it without Envy in this great Aſſembly: Yea, ſhould I write a whole
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:59886:232"/>Book in his Commendation, and Publiſh it, many of you would ſay, as a Philoſopher once did, who falling on a Book, Entituled,</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comium Herculis, <hi>ſaid with Indignation,</hi> Et quis Lacedaemoniorum eum vituperat? <hi>He thought it time ill ſpent to praiſe him whom none could blame. And I believe your ſelves are reſolved to make ſome ſuch Monument of your high Eſteem of him, that after-ages as well as the preſent ſhall know you valued him above my words. I know large Encomiaſtical praiſes of the Dead, unleſs their Lives were Eminent in Goodneſs, and free from any notable blot, are much condemned by the moſt Judicious and godly Divines, as a thing of very evil conſequence, becauſe they often prove Confections of Poyſon to the Living; for many, whoſe Lives ſpeak nothing for them, will draw the Example into conſequence, and be thereby led into hope that they may Preſs a</hi> Hackney Funeral Sermon <hi>to carry them to Heaven when they dye. On the other hand, it may be ſaid, that though common Graves deſerve no Inſcription, yet Marble Tombs are not without ſome Epitaph; Heroical and Vertuous Examples ſhould not go with a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Paſs, but with a Trumpet</hi> —</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Since then it muſt be ſo,</hi> jacta eſt alea, <hi>I ſhall impoſe upon my ſelf this Law, not to Build his Monument of common ſtones, nor trouble my ſelf and you to gather ſuch Flowers to caſt
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:59886:232"/>upon his Grave as grow in common Fields, nor deſcend or ſtoop to any thing which is not worthy of your higheſt Imitation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt then, <hi>For his Perſonal Endowments; he was certainly,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>A Perſon of a very ſweet Nature and Temper, ſo affable and Courteous, and chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, that he gained upon all that converſed with him; and if any tax'd him with any Pride or Moroſeneſs, or diſtantialneſs in his carriage, it muſt be only ſuch as did not know him; he had ſo winning a way with him, he might bid him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf welcom into whatſoever Houſe he enter'd. Pride and Moroſeneſs are bad qualities for a Man of his Employ, and make men afraid of the ways of God, for fear they ſhould never enjoy a good day after.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>A Perſon of a very great Gravity, and could carry a Majeſty in his Face when there was occaſion, and make the leaſt Guilt tremble in his preſence with his very Countenance. I never knew a Man better loved, nor more dreaded. God had given him ſuch a ſpirit with power, that his very frowns were darts, and his reproofs ſharper than ſwords; he would not contemn familiarity, but hated that fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity that bred contempt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>A Perſon of a very large Charity. He had large Bowels, and a large Heart; a great dexterity in the opening of the bowels of others,
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:59886:233"/>as well as his own, to works of Mercy, that I think I may ſay, there is not a Church in</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>that hath more often and more liberal Contributions for poor Miniſters, and other poor Chriſtians, than this hath, according to the proportion of their abilities.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>A Perſon of a wonderful Patience. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the many Weakneſſes and Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities which for a long time have been conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually without ceaſing, as it were, trying their skill to pull down his frail Body to the duſt, and at laſt effected it, yet I never heard an impatient word drop from him. When I came to viſit him, and asked him,</hi> How do you, Sir? <hi>He anſwered,</hi> Pretty well; I bleſs God I am well, I am contented with the Will of my Father, my Father's Will and Mine are but one Will. <hi>It made me often think of that, Iſa.</hi> 33.24. The Inhabitant ſhall not ſay, I am ſick; the People that dwell therein ſhall be forgiven their Iniquity. <hi>Sence of Pardon took away ſenſe of Sickneſs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>A Perſon of a very ſtrong Faith in the promiſes of both Worlds, and he could not be otherwiſe, being ſuch a continual Student in the Covenant; he feared nothing of himſelf, or others, knowing the Promiſe and Oath of God would ſtand firm, and the Head of the Church would ſee to the ſafety of all his Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers here and hereafter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="385" facs="tcp:59886:233"/>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>For his Miniſterial Endowments, he was,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>An Experienced Miniſter. From the Heart to the Heart, from the Conſcience to the Conſcience; he had a Body of Divinity in his Head, and the power of it upon his Heart.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>He was a Miniſter delighted in his work. It was his Meat and Drink to Labour in that great work, inſomuch that under his Weakneſs he would be often Preaching of little Sermons (as he called them) to thoſe that came to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit him, even when by reaſon of his Diſtemper they were very hardly able to underſtand him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>He was a ſucceſsful Miniſter. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument in the hand of God for the converſion of many Souls in this place and elſewhere.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>As to his Faithfulneſs in the Miniſtry: It was like Touch or Marble without any ſtreaming flaw; no Eccleſiaſtical Honours, Offices, or whatſoever bears the name of Greatneſs could bribe it. The two</hi> Indies <hi>would have been as Dirt; he knew the Pole he muſt Sail by, and ſteered not by a Mercenary Compaſs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>His Ends, ſo far as one may learn the mark by the Archers Eye, were not private Intereſts, Reſpects, or Parties.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>In a word, He was a Man of fixed Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, of a Maſculine Reſolution, and of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viting Familiarity, too generous to be cruel; too great a Chriſtian, to be courted into any ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:59886:234"/>complyance whatſoever: His Compaſs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Trepidation or Variation had conſtantly ſtood right to that Pole, the good of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and his Pariſhioners welfare. He lived a great Example of Piety and Vertue. And now he is at Reſt, but though he is gone, he is not loſt, he is yet <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſeful to the Church of God,</hi> and being dead, he yet ſpeaks by his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample and Writings, which are very Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable and Spiritual. <hi>But now I'le leave him in his Bed of Reſt, and draw the Curtains, and put out the Lights; only a word at part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>
                     </p>

                        <hi>And now</hi> Beloved Hearers, <hi>we may know how great the Tree that's fallen was, by the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuity or void place it leaves behind it. I look upon you as them that will endeavour to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the</hi> vacuum <hi>by acting from that Noble Principle which moves to the univerſal and common good: The Loſs we have ſuſtained is great; and they ſay, that when a Limb or part of a Man is cut off,</hi> Anima retrahitur, <hi>the Soul is retracted; I wiſh the Philoſophy may be verified in the Retraction of his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Faithfulneſs unto you, that ſo he may remain among you in Quinteſſence and Vertue, being, as it were, divided among you, as they ſay of</hi> Romulus, <hi>that he was diſcerpt by the Senate when he died, and every Senator got a
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:59886:234"/>piece of him. Let nothing that was Exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary in him be put in his Grave, that neither we, nor our Poſterity may have cauſe to write upon his Tomb, as they did upon that of</hi> Brutus, Utinam Viveres.</p>
